/* Function:
    void FLEXCOM6_TWI_Initialize(void)

   Summary:
    Initializes given instance of the FLEXCOM TWI peripheral.

   Description:
    This function initializes the given instance of the FLEXCOM TWI peripheral as
    configured by the user from within the MHC.

   Precondition:
    None.

   Parameters:
    None.

   Returns:
    None

   Example:
    <code>
    FLEXCOM6_TWI_Initialize();
    </code>

   Remarks:
    Stops the FLEXCOM TWI if it was already running and reinitializes it.

/* Function:
    void FLEXCOM6_TWI_CallbackRegister(FLEXCOM_TWI_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t contextHandle)

   Summary:
    Sets the pointer to the function (and it's context) to be called when the
    given FLEXCOM TWI's transfer events occur.

   Description:
    This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back"
    when the given FLEXCOM TWI's transfer events occur. It also passes a context value
    (usually a pointer to a context structure) that is passed into the
    function when it is called.

   Precondition:
    FLEXCOM6_TWI_Initialize must have been called for the associated FLEXCOM TWI instance.

   Parameters:
    callback - A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined
    by the FLEXCOM_TWI_CALLBACK data type.

    context - A value (usually a pointer) passed (unused) into the function
    identified by the callback parameter.

   Returns:
    None.

   Example:
    <code>
    FLEXCOM6_TWI_CallbackRegister(MyFlexcomTwiCallback, &myData);
    </code>

   Remarks:
    The context parameter is ignored if the pointer passed is NULL.
    To disable the callback function, pass a NULL for the callback parameter.
    See the FLEXCOM_TWI_CALLBACK type definition for additional information.

    True - Read request was successful.
    False - Read request has failed.

   Example:
    <code>
        uint8_t myData [NUM_BYTES];

   Summary:
    Writes data onto the slave.

   Description:
    This function writes the data from pdata buffer of size in bytes equal to
    length onto the slave with given address. Master will generate Stop
    condition after completion of the write.

   Precondition:
    FLEXCOM6_TWI_Initialize must have been called for the associated FLEXCOM TWI instance.

   Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.

   Summary:
    Write and Read data from Slave.

   Description:
    This function writes data from wdata buffer to the slave of given address and
    of size(in bytes) equal to wlength. Master then generates a repeated start and
    do a read operation. Read operation reads data into rdata buffer of size(in
    bytes) equal to rlength from the slave of given address. Master generates a stop
    condition after reading the data.

   Precondition:
    FLEXCOM6_TWI_Initialize must have been called for the associated FLEXCOM TWI instance.

   Parameters:
    address - 7-bit / 10-bit slave address.
    wdata   - pointer to write data buffer
    wlength - write data length in bytes.
    rdata   - pointer to read data buffer.
    rlength - read data length in bytes.

   Returns:
