# MPLAB® Harmony 3 Reference Applications

MPLAB® Harmony 3 is an extension of the MPLAB® ecosystem for creating
embedded firmware solutions for Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC® microcontroller
and microprocessor devices.  Refer to the following links for more information.

- [Microchip 32-bit MCUs](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit)
- [Microchip 32-bit MPUs](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit-mpus)
- [Microchip MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
- [Microchip MPLAB® Harmony](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-harmony)
- [Microchip MPLAB® Harmony Pages](https://microchip-mplab-harmony.github.io/)

This repository contains the MPLAB® Harmony 3 Reference Application Package.

Reference applications are standalone applications which demonstrates specific
features or capabilities of Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC MCUs. These applications
are developed on Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC development boards/kits.

In addition to having the MCU, the 32-bit SAM and PIC MCU development boards/kits
also provide support to exercise the features of MCU through additional hardware
like displays, communication buses, transceivers, sensors, external memories, etc.
The additional hardware features are available on the MCU development boards/kits
or is available as plugin through interface headers like mikroBUS Click or Xplained Pro extensions.

Following are the typical application types in this repository
- Large feature-rich applications involving integration of several technologies like Audio, USB, TCP/IP, Wireless, Security, Low Power, RTOS, etc
- Applications demonstrating certain capabilities of the Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC MCUs. For example: Low Power application on SAM L21 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit demonstrating idle and standby modes
- Applications demonstrating capabilities of Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC MCUs development boards/kits (Curiosity, Nano, etc.) which allows extending hardware capability through mikroBUS Click or Xplained Pro extensions
- Getting started applications pertaining to the Microchip's MCU products. These getting started applications demonstrates usage of MPLAB Harmony 3 framework by exercising commonly used peripheral features

The above application types serve as a reference source to evaluate solutions on 32-bit SAM and PIC MCUs by developing applications using MPLAB Harmony 3 software framework on Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC development boards/kits.
