The audio is played through the CODEC placed on the X32 header interface. It also provides feature to switch to the next track on the media. The sdcard_player application plays .wav files from the SD Card. The SD Card driver uses the SPI driver to interact with the SD Card. The application uses the File System Service to read/write data on the SD Card. The audio data read from the SD card is decoded by passing it to the WAV decoder. The decoded output is saved in the output buffers 1 and 2 which are used in ping pong manner. The output buffers 1 and 2 are submitted to the Codec driver for playing. The Codec is configured for 16-bit data and 48 kHz sampling frequency. The Codec driver sends the audio data to the AK4954 Codec using the I2S driver, which in turn uses DMA to transfer the audio data. The Codec driver uses the I2C driver to send commands to the AK4954 Codec. ",

    "content": "The Live update application uses the dual bank flash feature available on the PIC32MZ Microcontrollers (MCUs). The banks on PIC32MZ MCU are named as BANK1 and BANK2. At any point of time, the application considers the bank on which it is currently executing from as active bank while the other bank is marked as inactive bank. The dual bank flash enables programming the inactive bank with a new version of the firmware while running the current version of the firmware from the active bank. The application updates the new version of the firmware to the inactive bank while the current version of the firmware runs from the active bank. The application identifies the flash bank which has the latest version of the firmware (active bank) and toggles a specific LED at a periodic rate. For example, it starts with toggling LED1 and when there is bank swap (active bank changed following successful upgrade), it toggles LED2. Similarly, the process repeats for every successful application firmware update. ",

The AVR ATMega4809 application shows how to implement a command line interface. This way, the microcontroller can receive control commands via the USART. In this use case, an LED is controlled using commands sent from the MPLAB Data Visualizer. The application shows steps to get started migrating to SAMD21 and later extend the functionality by adding more peripherals. The migration application makes use of SAM D21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit and MPLAB® Harmony v3 framework. The application sends “Hello World” message to serial terminal using (SERCOM) USART and utilizes STDIO library to receive the command from the serial terminal to control the LED0 on SAMD21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit. Switch SW0 is configured with External Interrupt controller (EIC) to toggle the LED0, when switch is pressed. It allows demonstrates Serial Peripheral Interface(SPI) self loop back mode and Direct memory Address (DMA) to send SPI self loopback status to the serial terminal. ",

This example shows how to migrate an application from PIC18F47Q10 MCU to SAMD21G17D MCU. This application uses the PIC18 application which helps in Getting Started with UART Using EUSART on PIC18. The PIC18 application shows how to implement a command line interface. This way, the microcontroller can receive control commands via the EUSART. In this use case, an LED is controlled using commands sent from the MPLAB Data Visualizer. The application shows steps to get started migrating to SAMD21 and later extend the functionality by adding more peripherals. The migration application makes use of SAM D21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit and MPLAB® Harmony v3 framework. The application sends “Hello World” message to serial terminal using (SERCOM) USART and utilizes STDIO library to receive the command from the serial terminal to control the LED0 on SAMD21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit. Switch SW0 is configured with External Interrupt controller (EIC) to toggle the LED0, when switch is pressed. It allows demonstrates Serial Peripheral Interface(SPI) self loop back mode and Direct memory Address (DMA) to send SPI self loopback status to the serial terminal. ",

The folder also contains Over the Air (OTA) firmware upgrade feature for the smart Applications. SAM D21 is an low-power, high-performance Microchip’s ARM® Cortex®-M0+ based flash microcontroller, it is ideal for a wide range of home automation, consumer, metering, and industrial applications. Microchip offers a low cost SAM D21 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit to evaluate SAMD21G17D microcontroller. Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) is Amazon’s managed service that makes it easy to integrate Alexa into your product With ACK, you don’t need to write an Alexa skill, manage a cloud service, or develop complex network and security firmware to connect your product to Alexa. Instead, you integrate the ACK module into your product. ACK provides the managed services, software, and tools you can use to develop and manage your Alexa-connected products on an ongoing basis. Users can benefit from Alexa device control and other features, such as Amazon’s Wi-fi Simple Setup (WSS). The communication interface between SAM D21 and ACK module is through UART. | This folder contains a set of applications (under folder “applications) which uses Amazon Alexa connect kit (ACK) SDK with host microcontroller SAM D21. | The Application “HelloWorld” demonstrates turning ON/OFF of the development device (SAM D21 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit) | The Application “SmartLight” demonstrates controlling of smart light (LED0) on development device (SAM D21 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit) | The Application “Microwave” demonstrates controlling of a Microwave oven | The Application “DashReplenishment” demonstrates dashboard replenishment | . | The folder contains a folder “bootloader”.

Connect the board to the host PC’s USB port to power-up the board. | Alternatively, the board can be powered using a Li-Po battery. In order to perform Firmware upgrade or WiFi configuration, the board must be connected through USB port. | Once connected to PC, a mass storage drive icon by the name CURIOSITY will appear. | . 2. Running the Demo . | Open the drive and click open the CLICK-ME.HTM file to launch the Google IoT cloud landing page. | In the landing page, enter Wi-Fi credentials (SSID, Password, security type) and download WIFI.CFG file. | Drag &amp; Drop the downloaded WIFI.CFG onto the CURIOSITY drive to set the Wi-Fi credentials. | If the Wi-Fi network is active, then the SAM-IoT WG Development board establishes connectivity with the Wi-Fi network and securely connects to the Google IoT cloud. | After successful connection, the SAM-IoT WG Development board pushes the real time light and temperature sensors data to the landing page. | . 3. Firmware upgrade and WiFi configuration process . | Firmware upgrade through Drag &amp; Drop . | Download the latest version of hex file from the hex folder. Drag &amp; Drop the downloaded .hex file onto the CURIOSITY drive. | This will automatically program the microcontroller with the supplied .hex file. There is no need to open the MPLABX IDE to program the .hex file through Drag &amp; Drop method. | Firmware upgrade through MPLABX IDE . | . | This method is usually followed by most of the developers to program the .hex file from MPLABX IDE environment. | WiFi configuration through Drag &amp; Drop . | . | This is nothing but the WIFI.CFG Drag &amp; Drop method discussed in the previous section. | WiFi configuration through CLI . | . | Open a terminal application on the host PC for the virtual COM port of connected SAM-IoT WG Development board, with 9600-8-None-1 settings | Just enter the below command to set the Wi-Fi credentials. wifi &lt;SSID&gt;,&lt;PASSWORD&gt;,&lt;SECURITY TYPE&gt; | .

The application displays heart rate readings (in beats per minute - bpm) on a very low power consuming display and posts this Heart Rate data to Microchip Bluetooth Data (MBD) android mobile application via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The Mikro Elektronika Heart Rate 3 click board is used to read the heart pulse. Mikroelektronika eINK click bundle is used for displaying heart rate. The eINK click bundle contains the eINK click adapter board and the eINK display. BM71 Bluetooth module is used to send the heart rate data over BLE. The Heart Rate 3 click contains two integrated LEDs, a photosensitive element and advanced low noise analog front end to provide clean and accurate heart rate readings. It is enough to place an index finger on top of the sensor to get the heart rate via I2C interface. The eINK display is a very low power consumption display and it has the ability to retain the information, even after disconnecting from the power source. The host MCU SAM E51 is interfaced with the Heart Rate 3 click over the I2C interface and eINK click over SPI Interface. ",

    "content": "The Live update application uses the dual bank flash feature available on the SAME54 Microcontrollers (MCUs). The banks on SAME54 MCU are named as BANK-A and BANK-B. At any point in time, the application considers the bank on which it is currently executing as an active bank while the other bank is marked as an inactive bank. The dual bank flash enables programming the inactive bank with a new version of the firmware while running the current version of the firmware from the active bank. The application updates the new version of the firmware to the inactive bank while the current version of the firmware runs from the active bank. The Application Task checks the NVM Control status register to identify the flash bank which has the latest version of the firmware (active bank) and toggles a specific LED at a periodic rate. For example, when there is no Live update then the LED1 is toggled for every 500ms if the application running from BANK-A else 1000ms if it is running from BANK-B. When there is a Live update request from the Host PC, after receiving the firmware image, the LED1 stops toggling and LED2 starts toggling with the toggle rate same as LED1. After a successful Live update i.e., by pressing the SW2, the device swaps the banks and resets. Then the LED2 stops toggling and LED1 starts toggling. Here, you can observe the change in the LED1 toggle rate after firmware upgrade. For example, the LED1 is toggled for every 500ms if the application running from BANK-A else 1000ms if it is running from BANK-B. ",

You should see the following messages (containing the temperature value in °F) on the terminal every 500 milliseconds for the duration the light sensor is covered | Observe Current Consumption on Data Visualizer Note:The Data Visualizer is a program to process and visualize data. The Data Visualizer can receive data from various sources such as the Embedded Debugger Data Gateway Interface (EDBG DGI) and COM ports. It is possible to track an application in run-time using a terminal graph or oscilloscope. It analyzes the power consumption of an application through correlation of code execution and power consumption when used together with a supported probe or board. | Open the Data Visualizer application from your PC and select the connected SAM L10 Xplained Pro B board on the DGI Control Panel, then click on Connect. The Data Visualizer will then start searching for protocols from the SAM L10 Xplained Pro board through the EDBG | Once the Data Visualizer is connected to the SAM L10 EDBG, different interfaces will appear. Select the Power interface and click on the Start button to start measuring the power consumption of the device | Ensure that the jumpers for Current Measurement on the SAM L10 Xplained Pro are set to MEASURE for the MCU and BYPASS for the I/Os | The Power Analysis window will appear on the Data Visualizer tool interface | The step image shows the device in Standby mode with its measured power consumption. You can observe small peaks that illustrate the 500 milliseconds Real-Time Clock (RTC) timer expiry Note: The average value is considered when measuring the power consumption of the device because the instant value is not stable. Then, the power consumption of the device in Standby mode is 8.66 µA. | Cover the light sensor on the I/O Xplained Pro board by placing your hand over it (or another element) to print the temperature on the terminal and observe the power consumption of the device | Press the SW0 button to switch from Standby mode to Idle mode. The following image shows the transition of the power consumption from Standby mode to Idle mode | The following image shows the device in Idle mode with a measured power consumption of 844 µA Note: You can observe that the small peaks coming from RTC timer expiry disappeared because the power consumption in Idle mode is higher than the power required to start ADC conversion. | Place your hand over the light sensor. The device will wake up on the next ADC window monitor interrupt, read and print data on serial and then re-enter Standby mode. The following image shows the transition of the power consumption by switching from Idle mode to Standby mode Note that the above results highlight the power consumption is lower in Standby mode than in Idle mode. | . | Wake-up Time Measurement Using Logic Analyzer/ Cathode-Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) To demonstrate the CPU wake up time, switch SW0 is configured to generate an interrupt. A General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) is toggled in the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) of the switch press event. The MCU comes out of Sleep mode when an interrupt occurs (in this case, the switch press interrupt). The time between the switch press and the GPIO toggle in the ISR is the wake up time. | Connect your logic analyzer or your CRO to the board according to the step image | Press the SW0 switch and capture the signals to measure the wake-up time in Standby and Idle mode. The following image shows the wake-up time from Standby mode | The following image shows the wake-up time from Idle mode By observing the outputs, you can conclude that the wake-up time is greater in Standby mode than in Idle mode | . | .

    "content": "This Application demonstrates the TrustZone feature on SAM L11 microcontroller (MCU). The application has two projects pertaining to Secure and Non-Secure modes of SAM L11, that work together on the same MCU and offers security isolation between the trusted and the non-trusted resources in the device. | The Secure mode application reads the current room temperature from the temperature sensor on the I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit every 500 milliseconds. Further, the application writes the temperature readings to EEPROM and reads when a request received from the Non-secure mode application. Also, an LED (LED0) is toggled every time the temperature is displayed on the serial console. The periodicity of the temperature values reading can be changed to 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and back to 500 milliseconds every time when the user presses the switch SW0 on the SAM L11 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit. The temperature readings are transferred to Non-secure mode application when it requests to Secure application through Non Secure Callables (NSC). | The Non-secure mode application requests the Secure mode application temperature values and prints them on a serial console once it receives from the Secure mode application. Further, when it receives a request from the user (in the form of a key press on the serial console), it will request Secure mode application to retrieve the last five stored temperature values in the EEPROM. The Non-secure application prints the last five stored temperature values on the console. | . ",

The Data Visualizer can receive data from various sources such as the Embedded Debugger Data Gateway Interface (EDBG DGI) and COM ports. It is possible to track an application in run-time using a terminal graph or oscilloscope. It analyzes the power consumption of an application through correlation of code execution and power consumption when used together with a supported probe or board. | Open the Data Visualizer application from your PC and select the connected SAM L21 Xplained Pro B board on the DGI Control Panel, then click on Connect. The Data Visualizer will then start searching for protocols from the SAM L21 Xplained Pro board through the EDBG | Once the Data Visualizer is connected to the SAM L21 EDBG, different interfaces will appear. Select the Power interface and click on the Start button to start measuring the power consumption of the device | Ensure that the jumpers for Current Measurement on the SAM L21 Xplained Pro are set to MEASURE for the MCU and BYPASS for the I/Os | The Power Analysis window will appear on the Data Visualizer tool interface | The step image shows the device in Standby mode with its measured power consumption. You can observe small peaks that illustrate the 500 milliseconds Real-Time Clock (RTC) timer expiry Note: The average value is considered when measuring the power consumption of the device because the instant value is not stable. Then, the power consumption of the device in Standby mode is 6.99 µA. | Cover the light sensor on the I/O Xplained Pro board by placing your hand over it (or another element) to print the temperature on the terminal and observe the power consumption of the device | Press the SW0 button to switch from Standby mode to Idle mode. The following image shows the transition of the power consumption from Standby mode to Idle mode | The following image shows the device in Idle mode with a measured power consumption of 530 µA | . Note: You can observe that the small peaks coming from RTC timer expiry disappeared because the power consumption in Idle mode is higher than the power required to start ADC conversion. | Place your hand over the light sensor. The device will wake up on the next ADC window monitor interrupt, read and print data on serial and then re-enter Standby mode.

Note that the above results highlight the power consumption is lower in Standby mode than in Idle mode. | Wake-up Time Measurement Using Logic Analyzer/ Cathode-Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) To demonstrate the CPU wake up time, switch SW0 is configured to generate an interrupt. A General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) is toggled in the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) of the switch press event. The MCU comes out of Sleep mode when an interrupt occurs (in this case, the switch press interrupt). The time between the switch press and the GPIO toggle in the ISR is the wake up time. | Connect your logic analyzer or your CRO to the board according to the step image | Press the SW0 switch and capture the signals to measure the wake-up time in Standby and Idle mode. The following image shows the wake-up time from Standby mode | The following image shows the wake-up time from Idle mode | By observing the outputs, you can conclude that the wake-up time is greater in Standby mode than in Idle mode | .
