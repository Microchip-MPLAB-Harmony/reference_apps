    "content": "This application demonstrates the TrustZone feature on the PIC32CM LS00 microcontroller (MCU). The application has two projects pertaining to Secure and Non-Secure modes of PIC32CM LS00 that work together on the same MCU and offers security isolation between the trusted and the non-trusted resources in the device. | The application includes Basic and Extended functionalites. | Basic application: . | The Secure mode application toggles an LED (LED0 toggles when the switch SW0 is pressed) on a timeout basis and the periodicity of the timeout will change from 500 milliseconds to one second, two seconds, four seconds, and back to 500 milliseconds every time you press the switch SW0 on the PIC32CM LS00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit. | The Non-secure application requests the Secure mode application, reads the LED toggling rate and prints on the serial terminal. The LED toggling rate data is transferred to the Non-secure mode application when it requests to Secure application through Non-Secure Callables (NSC). | . | Extended application: . | The Secure mode application reads the current room temperature from the temperature sensor on the I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit every 500 milliseconds. Further, the application writes the temperature readings to EEPROM and reads when a request is received from the Non-secure mode application. Also, a green LED (LED0) is toggled every time the temperature display request is received from the Non-secure mode application.

The LED toggling rate data is transferred to the Non-secure mode application when it requests to Secure application through Non-Secure Callables (NSC). | . | Extended application: . | The Secure mode application reads the current room temperature from the temperature sensor on the I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit every 500 milliseconds. Further, the application writes the temperature readings to EEPROM and reads when a request is received from the Non-secure mode application. Also, a green LED (LED0) is toggled every time the temperature display request is received from the Non-secure mode application.

Typical IoT application development problem can be partitioned into three blocks: - Smart (Application logic): Implemented through the PIC32CM MC00 microcontroller - Security: Implemented through the ATECC608 secure element - Connectivity: Implemented through the ATWINC1510 WiFi controller module . This application utilizes Mikroelektronika click interface and Microchip XPRO interfaces available on Curiosity Nano base to create a Google IoT node application. The application demonstrates MQTT data transfer of Object ID (RFID Tag data) and the object surface temperature value (contactless read) to Google IoT cloud. This application is helpful in RFID-based temperature sensing and monitoring tags. For example, passive RFID temperature sensors are applied to assets and signal an alarm if an asset gets too close to unacceptable temperature levels.

The audio is played through the CODEC placed on the X32 header interface. It also provides feature to switch to the next track on the media. The sdcard_player application plays .wav files from the SD Card. The SD Card driver uses the SPI driver to interact with the SD Card. The application uses the File System Service to read/write data on the SD Card. The audio data read from the SD card is decoded by passing it to the WAV decoder. The decoded output is saved in the output buffers 1 and 2 which are used in ping pong manner. The output buffers 1 and 2 are submitted to the Codec driver for playing. The Codec is configured for 16-bit data and 48 kHz sampling frequency. The Codec driver sends the audio data to the AK4954 Codec using the I2S driver, which in turn uses DMA to transfer the audio data. The Codec driver uses the I2C driver to send commands to the AK4954 Codec. The application displays audio track from the SD card. It also provides volume increase/decrease scroll bar, Play/Pause button, Next Track button, Previous Track button. ",

    "content": "The Live update application uses the dual bank flash feature available on the PIC32MZ Microcontrollers (MCUs). The banks on PIC32MZ MCU are named as BANK1 and BANK2. At any point of time, the application considers the bank on which it is currently executing from as active bank while the other bank is marked as inactive bank. The dual bank flash enables programming the inactive bank with a new version of the firmware while running the current version of the firmware from the active bank. The application updates the new version of the firmware to the inactive bank while the current version of the firmware runs from the active bank. The application identifies the flash bank which has the latest version of the firmware (active bank) and toggles a specific LED at a periodic rate. For example, it starts with toggling LED1 and when there is bank swap (active bank changed following successful upgrade), it toggles LED2. Similarly, the process repeats for every successful application firmware update. ",

The AVR ATMega4809 application shows how to implement a command line interface. This way, the microcontroller can receive control commands via the USART. In this use case, an LED is controlled using commands sent from the MPLAB Data Visualizer. The application shows steps to get started migrating to SAMD21 and later extend the functionality by adding more peripherals. The migration application makes use of SAM D21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit and MPLAB® Harmony v3 framework. The application sends “Hello World” message to serial terminal using (SERCOM) USART and utilizes STDIO library to receive the command from the serial terminal to control the LED0 on SAMD21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit. Switch SW0 is configured with External Interrupt controller (EIC) to toggle the LED0, when switch is pressed. It allows demonstrates Serial Peripheral Interface(SPI) self loop back mode and Direct memory Address (DMA) to send SPI self loopback status to the serial terminal. ",

    "content": "This Applications acts as reference for migrating applications from 8-bit PIC Microcontroller (MCU) to 32- bit MCU. This example shows how to migrate an application from PIC18F47Q10 MCU to SAMD21G17D MCU. This application uses the PIC18 application which helps in Getting Started with UART Using EUSART on PIC18. The PIC18 application shows how to implement a command line interface. This way, the microcontroller can receive control commands via the EUSART. In this use case, an LED is controlled using commands sent from the MPLAB Data Visualizer. The application shows steps to get started migrating to SAMD21 and later extend the functionality by adding more peripherals. The migration application makes use of SAM D21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit and MPLAB® Harmony v3 framework. The application sends “Hello World” message to serial terminal using (SERCOM) USART and utilizes STDIO library to receive the command from the serial terminal to control the LED0 on SAMD21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit. Switch SW0 is configured with External Interrupt controller (EIC) to toggle the LED0, when switch is pressed. It allows demonstrates Serial Peripheral Interface(SPI) self loop back mode and Direct memory Address (DMA) to send SPI self loopback status to the serial terminal. ",

    "content": "This folder contains the SAM D21 microcontroller port for Amazon’s Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) Software Development Kit (SDK) and smart applications demonstrating the port. The folder also contains Over the Air (OTA) firmware upgrade feature for the smart Applications. SAM D21 is an low-power, high-performance Microchip’s ARM® Cortex®-M0+ based flash microcontroller, it is ideal for a wide range of home automation, consumer, metering, and industrial applications. Microchip offers a low cost SAM D21 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit to evaluate SAMD21G17D microcontroller. Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) is Amazon’s managed service that makes it easy to integrate Alexa into your product With ACK, you don’t need to write an Alexa skill, manage a cloud service, or develop complex network and security firmware to connect your product to Alexa. Instead, you integrate the ACK module into your product. ACK provides the managed services, software, and tools you can use to develop and manage your Alexa-connected products on an ongoing basis. Users can benefit from Alexa device control and other features, such as Amazon’s Wi-fi Simple Setup (WSS). The communication interface between SAM D21 and ACK module is through UART. | This folder contains a set of applications (under folder “applications) which uses Amazon Alexa connect kit (ACK) SDK with host microcontroller SAM D21. | The Application “HelloWorld” demonstrates turning ON/OFF of the development device (SAM D21 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit) | The Application “SmartLight” demonstrates controlling of smart light (LED0) on development device (SAM D21 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit) | The Application “Microwave” demonstrates controlling of a Microwave oven | The Application “DashReplenishment” demonstrates dashboard replenishment | . | The folder contains a folder “bootloader”. The bootloader helps demonstrate OTA firmware upgrade feature. | .

Running the Demo . | Open the drive and click open the CLICK-ME.HTM file to launch the Google IoT cloud landing page. | In the landing page, enter Wi-Fi credentials (SSID, Password, security type) and download WIFI.CFG file. | Drag &amp; Drop the downloaded WIFI.CFG onto the CURIOSITY drive to set the Wi-Fi credentials. | If the Wi-Fi network is active, then the SAM-IoT WG Development board establishes connectivity with the Wi-Fi network and securely connects to the Google IoT cloud. | After successful connection, the SAM-IoT WG Development board pushes the real time light and temperature sensors data to the landing page. | . 3. Firmware upgrade and WiFi configuration process . | Firmware upgrade through Drag &amp; Drop . | Download the latest version of hex file from the hex folder. Drag &amp; Drop the downloaded .hex file onto the CURIOSITY drive. | This will automatically program the microcontroller with the supplied .hex file. There is no need to open the MPLABX IDE to program the .hex file through Drag &amp; Drop method. | Firmware upgrade through MPLABX IDE . | . | This method is usually followed by most of the developers to program the .hex file from MPLABX IDE environment. | WiFi configuration through Drag &amp; Drop . | . | This is nothing but the WIFI.CFG Drag &amp; Drop method discussed in the previous section. | WiFi configuration through CLI . | . | Open a terminal application on the host PC for the virtual COM port of connected SAM-IoT WG Development board, with 9600-8-None-1 settings | Just enter the below command to set the Wi-Fi credentials. wifi &lt;SSID&gt;,&lt;PASSWORD&gt;,&lt;SECURITY TYPE&gt; | .

    "title": "AWS Account Setup",
    "content": "Details . To run the AWS Cloud IoT core solution, an AWS account is required. The following are the steps to configure an AWS account. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides computing services for a fee. Some are offered for free on a trial or small-scale basis. By signing up for your AWS account, you are establishing an account to access a wide range of computing services. Think of your AWS account as your root account for AWS services. It is very powerful and gives you complete access. Be sure to protect your username and password. You control access to your AWS account by creating individual users and groups using the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Console. You also assign policies (permissions) to the group from the IAM Console. Create your own AWS account . | Create AWS account. Go to AWS website and follow instructions to create your own AWS account. Additional details can be found at create and activate a new AWS account. | Secure root account with MFA (multi-factor authentication) This is an important step to better secure your root account against attackers. Anyone logging in not only needs to know the password, but also a constantly changing code generated by an MFA device. AWS recommends a number of MFA device options at the following link: https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/ The quickest solution is a virtual MFA device running on a phone. These apps provide the ability to scan the QR code AWS will generate to set up the MFA device. a. Return to https://aws.amazon.com/ and click the Sign In to the Console. b. If it asks for an IAM user name and password, select the Sign-in using root account credentials link. c. Enter the email and password for your AWS account. d. Under Find Services search for IAM and select it to bring up the Identity and Access Management options. e. Click on Activate MFA (Multi-factor Authentication) on your root account. f. Create an admin IAM user AWS best practices recommend not using your root account for standard administrative tasks, but to create a special admin user for those tasks. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#lock-away-credentials . | Follow the instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html for creating an admin user. | Enable MFA (multi-factor authentication) for the admin user. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#enable-mfa-for-privileged-users . | . Configuring the account using CloudFormation Templates . The usage of a custom PKI with TrustFLEX devices uses the Just-In-Time Registration (JITR) feature of AWS IoT Core. This feature requires a number of resources setup with an AWS account to work. The creation of these resources is automated through the AWS CloudFormation service. | Sign into the AWS console using the admin user created in the previous section. | Change to region to US East (Ohio) (a.k.a. us-east-2). This is done from a dropdown in the top right of the console webpage after logging in. | Under Find Services search for CloudFormation and select it to bring up that service. | Click Create Stack button. | Select Upload a template file from the page of the stack creation. | Click Choose file and upload the aws-zero-touch-full-setup.yaml file. Note: If running from a China region, you’ll need to select the aws-zero-touch-full- setup-cn.yaml instead. These files are available in ~/.trustplatform folder. | Click Next to move on to the stack details. | Enter TrustFLEX as the stack name. Actual name isn’t important, just has to be unique. | Enter a password for the user that will be created to run the demo under UserPassword. | Click Next to move on to the stack options. Nothing needs to be changed here. | Click Next to move on to the stack review. | Check the acknowledgement box regarding IAM resources at the bottom of the page. | Click Create Stack to start the resource creation. | Wait until the stack creation completes. This can take a few minutes. Once done, the stack you created will show as CREATE_COMPLETE. | Save demo credentials. Click the Outputs tab for the stack to see the credentials to be saved. | Save the credentials to aws_credentials.yaml file in ”~/.trustplatform/aws_credentials.yaml” folder.

    "content": "Details . AWS Lambda is a service that enables code to be run in the cloud without worrying about things like provisioning, server management, and scalability. It natively supports many different programming languages, and interfaces with a wide range of other AWS services to facilitate cloud development. we will use AWS Lambda to transfer temperature and light sensor data from SAM-IoT Development Board to cloud watch. The main concept that we will focus on is how to route data between AWS Lambda and AWS IoT Core. | Sensor data is sent from connected devices to the AWS Cloud as MQTT messages. | The data is forwarded from AWS IoT Core to AWS Lambda, where it is routed to cloud watch for plotting the graph. | . Creating a Role in AWS IAM . | Sign in to the AWS Management Console and select the IAM service. | Select Roles under Access Management in the menu on the left-hand side . | Click Create role. | Select AWS service as the trusted entity. | Select Lambda as the use case. | Click Next: Permissions. | Attach the AWSIoTDataAccess, CloudWatchFullAccess and AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole permission policies by using the search bar and ticking the relevant boxes. This will allow our Lambda function to send data to the AWS IoT Core and use Amazon CloudWatch logs. We will not cover Amazon CloudWatch in this tutorial, but it could be a useful tool for debugging your application later on. | Click Next: Tags. | Click Next: Review. | Enter Lambda_IoT_role as the Role name. | Click Create role . | . Designing an AWS Lambda function . Creating an empty Lambda function . AWS Lambda is a service that enables us to run code in the cloud without worrying about server management. It can be set up to send and receive data from many different services, such as AWS IoT Core, which we will make use of in this tutorial. To create an AWS Lambda function: . | Sign in to the AWS Management Console and select the Lambda service. | Select Functions in the menu on the left-hand side. | Click on Create function. | Choose Author from scratch. | Enter iot_Core_to_CwMetrics as the Function name. | Select Python 3.8 as the Runtime. | Expand Choose or create an execution role under Permissions and select Use an existing role. | Select the Lambda_IoT_role that we defined earlier . | Click on Create function. | . When the AWS Lambda function has been successfully created, the user should be redirected to the Configuration page for the iot_Core_to_CwMetrics function. This page can also be found by selecting Functions in the menu on the left-hand side in AWS Lambda and then selecting the function from the list. Triggering the Lambda function for relevant MQTT packages . The next step is to configure the Lambda function to trigger when messages containing sensor data are published over MQTT in AWS IoT Core: . | On the Lambda function’s configuration page, expand the Designer panel. | Click on Add trigger. | Select AWS IoT as the trigger in the dropdown menu. | Select Custom IoT rule. | In the Rule dropdown, select Create new rule. | Enter RouteSensorData as the Rule name. | Enter SELECT * FROM “$aws/things/ThingName/shadow/#” as the Rule query statement. NOTE : ThingName is the unique serial number of the device . | Click Add. | . Implementing the Lambda function . | Ensure that the iot_Core_to_CwMetrics function is selected in the Designer panel. | Paste the following Python code in the editor in the Function code panel import json # Python library for dealing with JSON objects import boto3 # boto3 is the AWS SDK for Python cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch') #Define payload attributes that may be changed based on device message schema ATTRIBUTES = ['temperature','light','state','reported'] # Define CloudWatch namespace CLOUDWATCH_NAMESPACE = \"thing2/MonitorMetrics\" # Define function to publish the metric data to CloudWatch def cw(topic, metricValue, metricName): metric_data = { 'MetricName': metricName, 'Dimensions': [{'Name': 'topic', 'Value': topic}], 'Unit': 'None', 'Value': metricValue, 'StorageResolution': 1 } cloudwatch.put_metric_data(MetricData=[metric_data],Namespace=CLOUDWATCH_NAMESPACE) return # Define the handler to loop through all the messages and looks to see if the message attributes # include light or temp and calls the cw() function if so to publish the custom metrics to Amazon CloudWatch def lambda_handler(event, context): my = list(event.values()) my_list = list(my[0].values()) print(my_list[0]) for e in my_list[0]: print(\"Received a message: {}\".format(str(e))) print(e) # Potential test point # Iterate through each attribute we'd like to publish for attribute in ATTRIBUTES: # Validate the event payload contains the desired attribute if attribute in e: print(\"publishing {} to CloudWatch\".format(attribute)) cw(\"SAM-IoT\", my_list[0][attribute], attribute) return event . | Click Save | .

    "content": "On power-up, the application prints a menu on a PC serial terminal. The menu provides options to measure the device power consumption in sleep modes or to measure wake-up time when the device is wake-up from one of the sleep modes. Once the option is selected, the application sets up EIC peripheral clock source and goes to standby sleep mode to enable measurement modes. In this training module, . | The power consumption of the SAM D21 Xplained Pro board is measured using two tools . | External Power Debugger - A hardware tool | Data Visualizer - A software tool | . | . The steps to connect and measure the power consumption using these tools are provided in the following sections. | Device wake-up time is measured using the Logic Analyzer. The steps to connect and measure the wake-up time are provided in the following sections. | . Power Measurement Mode: By default, the application is running with the device in standby sleep mode; while the device is in standby sleep mode, the user can measures the device’s power consumption in standby sleep mode by following the instructions provided in the following sections. The device wakes up from standby mode and enters active mode when you cover the light sensor (by placing a hand over it, for example) on the I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension kit. Here, the user can observe the transition of device power consumption from standby sleep mode to active mode on the Data Visualizer tool. The application prints the room temperature on a serial terminal, and the device goes back to standby sleep mode. The LED0 on the SAM D21 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit is toggled every time the serial console displays the temperature. When the user presses the switch button SW0, the application switches from standby sleep mode to idle sleep mode; here, the user can observe the transition of device power consumption from standby sleep mode to active mode and from active mode to idle Sleep mode. At this point, the user can measure the device’s power consumption in idle sleep mode by following the instructions provided in the following sections. The device wakes up from idle mode and enters active mode when you cover the light sensor (by placing a hand over it, for example) on the I/O1 Xplained Pro extension kit. Here, the user can observe the transition of device power consumption from idle sleep mode to active mode on the Data Visualizer tool. The application prints the room temperature on a serial terminal, and the device goes back to standby sleep mode. The LED0 on the SAM D21 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit is toggled every time the serial console displays the temperature. Wake-up Time Measurement Mode: By default, the application is running with the device in standby sleep mode, and the device wakes up from standby sleep mode when you press a switch on the development board. The application toggles the Wake-up GPIO pin on the device wake-up and then goes to the idle sleep mode. The user can measure the wake-up time by monitoring the switch SW0 pin and Wake-up GPIO pin on the Logic Analyzer tool. In the next switch press, the user can measure the wake-up time from idle sleep mode by monitoring the same switch SW0 pin and Wake-up GPIO pin on the Logic Analyzer tool. The application switches the device sleep mode between standby sleep mode and idle sleep mode whenever the user presses a switch SW0. Therefore, the user can measure the wake-up time from these sleep modes by monitoring the switch SW0 on the Logic Analyzer tool. Also, the device wakes up from standby mode or idle mode when you cover the light sensor by placing your hand, prints the wake-up reason message, and goes back to sleep mode. ",

You should see the temperature values (in °F) getting printed on the terminal when the light sensor is covered, as shown above. | Observe Current Consumption on Data Visualizer Note: The Data Visualizer is a program to process and visualize data. The Data Visualizer can receive data from various sources such as the Embedded Debugger Data Gateway Interface (EDBG DGI) and COM ports. It is possible to track an application in run-time using a terminal graph or oscilloscope. It analyzes the power consumption of an application through correlation of code execution and power consumption when used together with a supported probe or board. Note: Before start measuring the power consumption, power on reset the device and select the Power Measurement Mode by entering option ‘a’ on the Serial terminal. | Open the Data Visualizer application from your PC and select the connected Power Debugger Data Gateway board on the DGI Control Panel, then click on Connect. The Data Visualizer will then start searching for protocols from the Power Debugger board. | Once the Data Visualizer is connected to the Power Debugger, different interfaces will appear. Select the Power interface and click on the Start button to start measuring the power consumption of the device. | Ensure that the hardware setup connected as mentioned in the Setup section. Note: The Power Analysis window will appear on the Data Visualizer tool interface. | The image below shows the device in Standby mode with its measured power consumption. You can observe small peaks that illustrate the 500 milliseconds Real-Time Clock (RTC) timer expiry. Note: The average value is considered when measuring the power consumption of the device because the instant value is not stable. Then, the power consumption of the device in Standby mode is 11.4 µA. | Cover the light sensor on the I/O Xplained Pro board by placing your hand over it (or another element) to print the temperature on the terminal and observe the power consumption of the device. Note: The power consumption of the device in Active mode is 11.3 mA and the power consumption of the same device in Standby mode is 10.5 µA. This shows the device in Standby mode will consume less power. The message printed on serial terminal when you have done this step. | Press the SW0 button to switch from Standby mode to Idle mode. The following image shows the transition of the power consumption from Standby Sleep mode to Idle Sleep mode. The power consumption of the device in Standby Sleep mode is in uA and the power consumption of the same device in Idle Sleep mode is ~2.7 mA. This shows the device in Idle Sleep mode will consume little higher power than Standby Sleep mode. The message printed on serial terminal when you have done this step. | Place your hand nearer to the light sensor. Device wakes up, reads and prints temperature value on serial console, and re-enters the Standby mode. The following image shows the transition power consumption values from Idle to Standby mode. The message printed on serial terminal when you have done this step. The following image shows the device in Idle mode with a measured power consumption of 2680 µA. | You can observe that the small peaks coming from RTC timer expiry disappeared because the power consumption in Idle mode is higher than the power required to start AC conversion. Note that the above results highlight the power consumption is lower in Standby mode than in Idle mode. | Wake-up Time Measurement Using Logic Analyzer/ Cathode-Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) To demonstrate the CPU wake up time, switch SW0 is configured to generate an interrupt. A General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) is toggled in the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) of the switch press event. The MCU comes out of Sleep mode when an interrupt occurs (in this case, the switch press interrupt). The time between the switch press and the GPIO toggle in the ISR is the wake-up time. Before start measuring the Wake-up Time, power on reset the device and select the Wake-up Time Measurement Mode by entering option ‘b’ on the Serial terminal. | Connect your logic analyzer or your CRO to the board as mentioned in the Setup section. | Now, press the SW0 switch and capture the signals to measure the wake-up time from Standby Sleep to Active. The following image shows the wake-up time for the device Standby Sleep mode to Active Mode: . The message printed on serial terminal when you have done this step. | Press the SW0 switch and capture the signals to measure the wake-up time from Idle Sleep to Active. The following image shows the wake-up time for the device Idle Sleep mode to Active Mode: .

    "content": "The application demonstrates a solution based on Microchip products for the health care industry and wearable products. The application displays heart rate readings (in beats per minute - bpm) on a very low power consuming display and posts this Heart Rate data to Microchip Bluetooth Data (MBD) android mobile application via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The Mikro Elektronika Heart Rate 9 click board is used to read the heart pulse. Mikroelektronika Eink E-Paper display 2,9” 296x128 dots display is used for displaying heart rate. The Eink E-Paper display 2,9” 296x128 dots display device contains the eINK click adapter board and the Eink E-Paper display 2,9” 296x128 dots display. BM71 Bluetooth module is used to send the heart rate data over BLE. The Heart Rate 9 click introduces Microchip’s proprietary method of measuring multiple signals in a body using pseudorandom binary sequence generation and phase division multiplexing This algorithm for processing data from the sensor and it can send data for 3 different diodes (green, ir, red) who give out a diagram of the heartbeat and its frequency per minute. The Eink E-Paper display 2,9” 296x128 dots display is a very low power consumption display and it can retain the information, even after disconnecting from the power source. The host MCU SAM E51 is interfaced with the Heart Rate 9 click over the USART interface and eINK click over SPI Interface. ",

When the light sensor is covered, the device reads the room temperature using temperature sensor on the I/O1 Xplained Pro extension kit and displays it on the OLED C Click display board. The application periodically prints room temperature on a serial terminal while the light sensor is covered. The device goes back to standby mode when the user uncovers the light sensor. The temperature read is displayed on the OLED C Click and also on the serial console.

    "title": "Description:",
    "content": "This example demonstrates the communication with LR (Lora) click. The application is designed to communicate with LR click by sending and receiving messages. The application reads the parameters firmware version, radio mode, and radio frequency from the LR click and displays it on a serial terminal of SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit. The RN2483 module’s architecture has three types of commands that can be used, and each allows access to different module functions: . | LoRaWAN Class A and Class C configuration and control, using the mac group of commands | Low-level radio configuration and control, using the radio group of commands | Other module functions, using the sys group of commands | . In order to communicate with a LoRa network, a specific number of parameters need to be configured. Since two distinctive methods are offered for a device to become part of the network, each of these requires different parameters: . 1. Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) . where a device negotiates network encryption keys at the time it joins the network. For this, the device EUI (devEUI), application EUI (appEUI) and application key (appKey) need to be configured and then the OTAA procedure can start. All these keys will be provided by Lora gateway network providers, these keys can be loaded into RN2483 device using below commands . | mac set deveui (devEUI) | mac set appeui (appEUI) | mac set appkey (appKey) Once keys are loaded into RN2483, LR click can join the network using below command | mac join otaa Once the connection is succesful, data can be transmitted using below command | mac tx (type) (portno) (data) | . 2. Activation by Personalization (ABP) . where the device already contains the network keys and can directly start communication with the network. Configuring the device address (address), network session key (nwkSessKey) and application session key (appSesskey) is sufficient for this type of initialization.All these keys will be provided by Lora gateway network providers, these keys can be loaded into RN2483 device using below commands . | mac set devaddr (address) | mac set nwkskey (nwkSessKey) | mac set appskey (appSesskey) Once keys are loaded into RN2483, LR click can join the network using below command | mac join abp Once the connection is succesful, data can be transmitted using below command | mac tx (type) (portno) (data) | .

This example uses the I2C peripheral library in slave mode and emulates an EEPROM of 512 bytes. The emulated EEPROM consists of two pages, each of size 256 bytes. The I2C slave expects two bytes of memory address from the I2C master (USB I2C Click) and the memory address can range from 0x00 to 0x1FF. The following operation can be made on the I2C slave (emulated EEPROM). Byte Write: The I2C master sends the slave address, followed by two bytes of the memory address. The slave writes the provided data at the given memory address. Page Write: A page write is initiated the same way as a byte write, but the I2C master can write up to 256 bytes (1 page). If the I2C master sends more than 256 bytes to the I2C slave, the memory address will “roll over,” and previous data will be overwritten. During writing, the address “rollover” is from the last byte of the current page to the first byte. Read Operation: Reads the requested number of bytes from the start address of emulated EEPROM (i.e. 0x00 and the maximum 512 bytes can be read). ",

This will be printed on the serial port terminal. | . | Alternatively: Use ipconfig to get the IP address of the board and ping to test if the device is reachable. | . | An LED “LED2” on the SAM E54 Curiosity Ultra Development Board toggles when a motion is detected in front of the motion sensor (PIR click). | An JPEG format image with 320x240 resolution is captured and stored on the microSD Card. Check the logs in the terminal for the motion detection, start capture and saved image events. | Steps to preview the captured images: . | Step 1: Live streaming of captured images: . | An HTTP server is hosted by the demonstration application. Open a web browser and direct it to the board running the HTTP server by typing the URL in the address bar (for example, https://mchpboard_c or by entering the assigned IP address i.e. http://192.168.100.11/ in the URL bar), and then press Enter key. | On the loaded page, Go to the Motion Surveillance under the left Menu. | The following image shows how the Motion Surveillance page looks. When the motion sensor detects a motion, the captured images will be live previewed on this page. | . | Note: . | When the motion sensor detects a motion, the ArduCAM captures an image (resolution 320x240) and stores in web_pages/arducam folder on the microSD Card. | The maximum number of images that the application stores on the microSD Card is 255. If the number of images captured exceeds 255, the application overwrites the images from the beginning. User can increase the storage size based on the available free size of the microSD Card by changing the MAX_FILE_NAMES macro in the app_ardu_cam.h header file. | . | If any error (check logs in the terminal), reset the device or reload the page or click Motion Surveillance menu option. | . | . | Step 2: Preview the images stored on the microSD Card using Windows Photo Viewer application: . | Remove the microSD Card from the J704 socket (back side of the board) on SAM E54 Curiosity Ultra Development Board and insert into personal computer. | Goto web_pages/arducam folder and preview the captured images using any photo preview application. | . | . | .

    "content": "The Live update application uses the dual bank flash feature available on the SAME54 Microcontrollers (MCUs). The banks on SAME54 MCU are named as BANK-A and BANK-B. At any point in time, the application considers the bank on which it is currently executing as an active bank while the other bank is marked as an inactive bank. The dual bank flash enables programming the inactive bank with a new version of the firmware while running the current version of the firmware from the active bank. The application updates the new version of the firmware to the inactive bank while the current version of the firmware runs from the active bank. The Application Task checks the NVM Control status register to identify the flash bank which has the latest version of the firmware (active bank) and toggles a specific LED at a periodic rate. For example, when there is no Live update then the LED1 is toggled for every 500ms if the application running from BANK-A else 1000ms if it is running from BANK-B. When there is a Live update request from the Host PC, after receiving the firmware image, the LED1 stops toggling and LED2 starts toggling with the toggle rate same as LED1. After a successful Live update i.e., by pressing the SW2, the device swaps the banks and resets. Then the LED2 stops toggling and LED1 starts toggling. Here, you can observe the change in the LED1 toggle rate after firmware upgrade. For example, the LED1 is toggled for every 500ms if the application running from BANK-A else 1000ms if it is running from BANK-B. ",

Hardware Modification: . | IO1 Xplained Pro features Microchip’s AT30TSE758 temperature sensor chip with an 8 kbit serial EEPROM. The temperature sensor has two TWI addresses: one for the temperature sensor and one for the EEPROM. The A2 address line of TWI must be soldered to 0. This is done to modify the address of the EEPROM on the I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit so that it does not conflict with the address of EEPROM on SAM E70 Xplained Evaluation Kit. The modification changes the address of temperature sensor to 0x4B and EEPROM to 0x50. These modified addresses are used in this demo application | . ",

Further, the application writes the temperature readings to EEPROM and reads when a request received from the Non-secure mode application. Also, an LED (LED0) is toggled every time the temperature is displayed on the serial console. The periodicity of the temperature values reading can be changed to 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and back to 500 milliseconds every time when the user presses the switch SW0 on the SAM L11 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit. The temperature readings are transferred to Non-secure mode application when it requests to Secure application through Non Secure Callable (NSC). | The Non-secure mode application requests the Secure mode application temperature values and prints them on a serial console once it receives from the Secure mode application. Further, when it receives a request from the user (in the form of a key press on the serial console), it will request Secure mode application to retrieve the last five stored temperature values in the EEPROM.

The application will be in continuous low power standby mode until user presses a switch on SAM L21 Xplained board or initiate a communication from Bluetooth using MBD android app. Then device wakes up, reads heart rate , displays on eink dispaly and posts heart rate value to MBD android app via Bluetooth. The Mikro Elektronika Heart Rate 9 click board is used to read the heart pulse. Mikroelektronika eINK click bundle is used for displaying heart rate. The eINK click bundle contains the eINK click adapter board and the eINK display. BM71 Bluetooth module is used to send the heart rate data over BLE. The Heart Rate 9 click introduces Microchip’s proprietary method of measuring multiple signals in a body using pseudorandom binary sequence generation and phase division multiplexing This algorithm for processing data from the sensor and it can send data for 3 different diodes (green, ir, red) who give out a diagram of the heartbeat and its frequency per minute. The eINK display is a very low power consumption display and it can retain the information, even after disconnecting from the power source. The host MCU SAM L21 is interfaced with the Heart Rate 9 click over the USART interface and eINK click over SPI Interface. ",

You should see the following messages (containing the temperature value in °F) on the terminal every 500 milliseconds for the duration the light sensor is covered | Observe Current Consumption on Data Visualizer Note:The Data Visualizer is a program to process and visualize data. The Data Visualizer can receive data from various sources such as the Embedded Debugger Data Gateway Interface (EDBG DGI) and COM ports. It is possible to track an application in run-time using a terminal graph or oscilloscope. It analyzes the power consumption of an application through correlation of code execution and power consumption when used together with a supported probe or board. | Open the Data Visualizer application from your PC and select the connected SAM L21 Xplained Pro B board on the DGI Control Panel, then click on Connect. The Data Visualizer will then start searching for protocols from the SAM L21 Xplained Pro board through the EDBG | Once the Data Visualizer is connected to the SAM L21 EDBG, different interfaces will appear. Select the Power interface and click on the Start button to start measuring the power consumption of the device | Ensure that the jumpers for Current Measurement on the SAM L21 Xplained Pro are set to MEASURE for the MCU and BYPASS for the I/Os | The Power Analysis window will appear on the Data Visualizer tool interface | The step image shows the device in Standby mode with its measured power consumption. You can observe small peaks that illustrate the 500 milliseconds Real-Time Clock (RTC) timer expiry Note: The average value is considered when measuring the power consumption of the device because the instant value is not stable. Then, the power consumption of the device in Standby mode is 6.99 µA. | Cover the light sensor on the I/O Xplained Pro board by placing your hand over it (or another element) to print the temperature on the terminal and observe the power consumption of the device | Press the SW0 button to switch from Standby mode to Idle mode. The following image shows the transition of the power consumption from Standby mode to Idle mode | The following image shows the device in Idle mode with a measured power consumption of 530 µA | . Note: You can observe that the small peaks coming from RTC timer expiry disappeared because the power consumption in Idle mode is higher than the power required to start ADC conversion. | Place your hand over the light sensor. The device will wake up on the next ADC window monitor interrupt, read and print data on serial and then re-enter Standby mode. The following image shows the transition of the power consumption by switching from Idle mode to Standby mode | . Note that the above results highlight the power consumption is lower in Standby mode than in Idle mode. | Wake-up Time Measurement Using Logic Analyzer/ Cathode-Ray Oscilloscope (CRO) To demonstrate the CPU wake up time, switch SW0 is configured to generate an interrupt. A General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) is toggled in the Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) of the switch press event. The MCU comes out of Sleep mode when an interrupt occurs (in this case, the switch press interrupt). The time between the switch press and the GPIO toggle in the ISR is the wake up time. | Connect your logic analyzer or your CRO to the board according to the step image | Press the SW0 switch and capture the signals to measure the wake-up time in Standby and Idle mode. The following image shows the wake-up time from Standby mode | The following image shows the wake-up time from Idle mode | By observing the outputs, you can conclude that the wake-up time is greater in Standby mode than in Idle mode | .

The SDSPI driver uses an instance of the SPI driver to communicate to the SD card over the SPI bus. The application creates a directory named Dir1 in the root directory and creates a new file named DATA_LOG.txt. The application writes the light sensor and temperature values into this newly created file every 1 second and also display it on the SLCD. If the directory and file already exists the values are logged into the existing file itself. The logged light intensity and temperature values along with time stamp are read via USB with the SD card enumerated as an MSD( Mass Storage Device).
