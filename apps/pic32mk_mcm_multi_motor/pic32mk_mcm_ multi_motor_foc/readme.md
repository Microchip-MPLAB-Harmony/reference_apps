## Description:

The application implements an encoder-based Field Oriented Control (FOC) for up to three Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (PMSMs) on PIC32MK MCM multi-motor control platform. The key features include:
- Quadrature encoder signal and HALL signal based FOC for each PMSM.
- Easily configurable PMSM parameters, the number of PMSM to drive, and PWM period.
- PI gains can be automatically calculated by the SW.
- Alternative HALL-based start-up or alignment start-up.
- Alternative rotor angle HALL-based calibration, index-capture-based calibration, or index-reset-based calibration.


## Modules/Technology Used:
- Peripheral Modules
    - ADC
    - PWM
    - UART
- Driver Modules
    - X2C (virtual oscilloscope support driver)

## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:</span>

Refer [Project Manifest](./firmware/src/config/mclv2_pic32_mk_mcm_pim/harmony-manifest-success.yml) present in harmony-manifest-success.yml under the project folder *firmware/src/config/mclv2_pic32_mk_mcm_pim*
- Refer the [Release Notes](../../../release_notes.md#development-tools) to know the **MPLAB X IDE** and **MCC** Plugin version. Alternatively, [Click Here](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/reference_apps/blob/master/release_notes.md#development-tools)
- Any Serial Terminal application like Tera Term terminal application.




<span style="color:blue"> Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with. </span> To download original version of MPLAB Harmony v3 packages, refer to document [How to Use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Project Manifest Feature](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/How-to-Use-the-MPLAB-Harmony-v3-Project-Manifest-Feature-DS90003305.pdf)

## Hardware Setup
- Control board configuration
    - Short jumpers J4, J6. This is necessary for the DC/DC converter on the board to work properly.
    - Short jumpers J28, J29, J30, J34, J35, J36, J40, J41, J42. This is necessary for the board to receive quadrature encoded signals from the Hurst motors.
- Connection
    - Plug the DC power into the connector CN1 or CN2 on each driver board.
    - Plug the motor power lines into the connector CON1 on each driver board.
    - Plug each driver board into the connector J13, J14, J15 on the PIC32MK MCM control board.
    - Connect position sensor pins of each motor with the connector CN1, CN2, CN3 respectively on the control board.

## Software configurations
- Open files hal_motor_channel_x.h, where x equals 1, 2, 3. The macros of motor parameters are defined in the files.
- For the Hurst motor, the macros are already configured properly. However, make sure that the macro LONG_HURST is defined. 

## Programming
- Connect ICD4 with the connector P1 on the control board.
- Power on.
- Make sure that the LEDs D1, D2, D3 are all on, indicating the 12V, 5V, 3.3V are being supplied.
- Open the demo project( pic32mk_mcm_ multi_motor_foc/firmware/pic32mk_mcm_control_board.X) in MPLAB X IDE and set it as the main project.
- Click "make and program device main project".

## Running/Tuning The Demo 
- To start the motor, click the SWx button on the control board, where x equals 1, 2, 3.
- The motor shall spin after the click. Otherwise, power off and check the hardware setup, then power on.
- To change the speed reference, spin the POTx potentiometer on the control board. Observe the speed of the motor, it shall change according to the angle position of the potentiometer.
- To stop the motor, click the SWx Button again.
- Power off.

# Comments:
- This application demo builds and works out of box by following the instructions above in "Running the Demo" section. If you need to enhance/customize this application demo, you need to use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Software framework. Refer links below to setup and build your applications using MPLAB Harmony.
