## Description


> This application demonstrates the TrustZone feature on the PIC32CM LS00 microcontroller (MCU). The application has two projects pertaining to Secure and Non-Secure modes of PIC32CM LS00 that work together on the same MCU and offers security isolation between the trusted and the non-trusted resources in the device.

- The application includes Basic and Extended functionalites.

- **Basic application:**
    - The Secure mode application toggles an LED (LED0 toggles when the switch SW0 is pressed) on a timeout basis and the periodicity of the timeout will change from 500 milliseconds to one second, two seconds, four seconds, and back to 500 milliseconds every time you press the switch SW0 on the PIC32CM LS00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit.
    - The Non-secure application requests the Secure mode application, reads the LED toggling rate and prints on the serial terminal. The LED toggling rate data is transferred to the Non-secure mode application when it requests to Secure application through Non-Secure Callables (NSC).

- **Extended application:**
    - The Secure mode application reads the current room temperature from the temperature sensor on the I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit every 500 milliseconds. Further, the application writes the temperature readings to EEPROM and reads when a request is received from the Non-secure mode application. Also, a green LED (LED0) is toggled every time the temperature display request is received from the Non-secure mode application. The periodicity of the temperature values reading can be changed to 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and back to 500 milliseconds whenever the user presses the switch SW0 on the PIC32CM LS00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit. The temperature readings are transferred to the Non-secure mode application when it requests to Secure application through Non-Secure Callables (NSC).

    - The Non-secure mode application requests the Secure mode application the temperature values and prints them on a serial console once it receives from the Secure mode application. Further, when it gets a request from the user (in the form of a key press on the serial console), it will request the Secure mode application to retrieve the last five stored temperature values in the EEPROM. The Non-secure application prints the last five stored temperature values on the console. Also, a red LED (LED1) is toggled every time the temperature values are read from EEPROM.

## Modules/Technology Used:

## TrustZone Application Development Use Cases
- There are two use cases:

    - **Single Developer** (This application demonstrates a single developer use case)
    - **Dual Developer**

- **1. Single Developer**
  - A single developer develops both Secure and Non-Secure applications.
  - The following steps are automatically taken care of by the MCC.
      - MCC generates both Secure and Non-Secure projects and Sets the Secure project as a loadable project to the Non-Secure project

      <img src = "images/single_develper_usecase_01.png">

      - Configures the Secure project to generate the veneer library in the Non-Secure project path (NonSecure/firmware/tz_pic32cm_ls00_cpro_NonSecure.X/tz_pic32cm_ls00_cpro_Secure_sg_veneer.lib)

      <img src = "images/single_develper_usecase_02.png">

      - Configures the Non-Secure project to link the veneer library.

      <img src = "images/single_develper_usecase_03.png">

- **2. Dual Developer**
    - The dual developer use case involves two developers.
    - Initially, Developer A is responsible for developing the Secure application; then, Developer B is responsible for developing the Non-Secure application.
        - Refer [Comments](#Comments) for more details on the **"Dual Developer Application Development Use Case"**

    - Open the Tera Term terminal application on your PC (from the WindowsÂ® Start menu by pressing the Start button).
    - Set the baud rate to 115200.
    - Reset or power cycle the device. LED0 toggles for every 500 milliseconds during power cycle.
    - An LED (LED0) on the PIC32CM LS00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit toggles on every timeout basis and the default periodicity of the timeout is 500 milliseconds.
    - And also, the LED toggling rate is displayed on the serial terminal.
    - Press the switch SW0 on the PIC32CM LS00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit to change the periodicity of the timeout to one second.
    - Every subsequent pressing of the switch SW0 on the PIC32CM LS00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit changes the periodicity of the timeout to 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 500 milliseconds, and back to 1 second in cyclic order.
    - See the following figure for the output.  
      <img src = "images/result_01.png">

    - Perform [Hardware Setup 2](#Setup2) steps mentioned above, if not done already.

    - Open the Tera Term terminal application on your PC (from the WindowsÂ® Start menu by pressing the Start button)
    - Change the baud rate to 115200
    - Press **SW1** to start the running the extended functionality.
    - You should see the temperature values (in Â°F) being displayed on the terminal every 500 milliseconds, as shown below  
      <img src = "images/result1.png">
    - Also, notice the LED0 blinking at 500 millisecond rate
    - You may vary the temperature by placing your finger on the temperature sensor (for a few seconds)

    - Every subsequent pressing of switch **SW0** on PIC32CM LS00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit changes the default sampling
      rate to 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 500 ms and back to 1 second in cyclic order as shown below.  
      <img src = "images/result3.png">
    - While the temperature sampling rate changes on every switch **SW0** press, notice the LED0 toggling at the same sampling rate
    - Press any character on the terminal to display the last five values written to the EEPROM. Notice that a red LED (LED1) will be toggled when a key is pressed in the serial console to read the temperature values from the **secure EEPROM**.
