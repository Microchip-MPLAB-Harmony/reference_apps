## Description:

The application reads current room temperature from the temperature sensor and light level from light sensor on the I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension and sends it to the console.
The application will utilize below peripherals:
- SERCOM0 (as I²C) PLIB to read the temperature from a temperature sensor.
- SERCOM2 (as Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (USART)) PLIBs and STDIO library to print the temperature values on a COM (serial) port terminal application running on a PC.
- The ADC peripheral library is used to read data from the light sensor

## Modules/Technology Used:
- Peripheral Modules
	- SERCOM2(I2C)
	- ADC       
	- SERCOM0(USART)

## Hardware Used:

- [PIC32CM MC00 Curiosity Pro Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/EV15N46A)
- [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)   

## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> *This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:*</span>  

 - [MPLAB Harmony v3 "csp" repo v3.8.3](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp/releases/tag/v3.8.3)
 - [MPLAB Harmony v3 "dev_packs" repo v3.8.0](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/dev_packs/releases/tag/v3.8.0)  
 - [MPLAB Harmony v3 "mhc" repo v3.6.5](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/mhc/releases/tag/v3.6.5)    
 - MPLAB Harmony 3 Launcher Plugin v3.6.2
 - [MPLAB X IDE v5.45](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
 - [MPLAB XC32 Compiler v2.41](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers)
 - Any Serial Terminal application like Tera Term terminal application.  

<span style="color:blue"> *Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesn’t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with.* </span>

## Setup:
- Connect the PIC32CM MC00 Curiosity Pro Development Board to the Host PC as a USB Device through a Type-A male to micro-B USB cable connected to Micro-B USB (Debug USB) port

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps.  

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "PIC32CM1216MC00048"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below


## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (pic32cm_mc_curiosity_getting_started/firmware/pic32cm_mc00_curiosity_pro.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "PIC32CM MC00 Curiosity pro" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo:
- Open the Tera Term terminal application on your PC (from the Windows® Start menu by pressing the Start button)
- Set the baud rate to 9600
- Press the Reset switch on the PIC32CM MC00 Curiosity Pro Development Board.
- The application prints temperature and light sensor continuously.
