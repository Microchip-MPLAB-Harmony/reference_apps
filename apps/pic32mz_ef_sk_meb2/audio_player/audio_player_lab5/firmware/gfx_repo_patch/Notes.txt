The MPLAB Harmony v3 "gfx" repository (revision v3.6.0) hangs while regenerating the GAC source code.
This project (audio_player_lab5) has been created using the patch (in folder "gfx_repo_patch")
discussed in the following steps.

1. To reconfigure or regenerate the project (audio_player_lab5), Apply the patch by following below steps
    a. Close the project and Harmony 3 configurator before applying the patch.
    b. Make sure your MPLAB Harmony v3 "gfx" repository is intact with revision v3.6.0.
    c. Copy and paste "libaria.jar" from
       "your_downloaded_folder\audio_player_lab5\firmware\gfx_repo_patch\libaria.jar" to
       "your_harmony_repo\gfx\middleware\aria\library\plugins\libaria.jar"
    d. Copy and paste "gac.jar" from
       "your_downloaded_folder\audio_player_lab5\firmware\gfx_repo_patch\gac.jar" to
       "your_harmony_repo\gfx\middleware\aria\library\plugins\lib\gac.jar"
    e. Copy and paste "displaymanager.jar" from
       "your_downloaded_folder\audio_player_lab5\firmware\gfx_repo_patch\displaymanager.jar" to
       "your_harmony_repo\gfx\middleware\aria\hal\plugins\displaymanager.jar"
    f. Copy and paste "legato_imagedecoder_raw.c" from
       "your_downloaded_folder\audio_player_lab5\firmware\gfx_repo_patch\legato_imagedecoder_raw.c" to
       "your_harmony_repo\gfx\middleware\legato\library\src\gfx\legato\image\raw\legato_imagedecoder_raw.c"
    g. Now, you can open the project in the MPLAB X IDE, Launch Harmony 3 configurator and reconfigure/regenerate.

Note:
1. The exisiting demo application (audio_player_lab5) builds and works without the application of the patch discussed above.
   The patch needs to be applied only if you wish to reconfigure or regenerate the existing demo application.
2. This fix will be released in "gfx v3.7.0".
