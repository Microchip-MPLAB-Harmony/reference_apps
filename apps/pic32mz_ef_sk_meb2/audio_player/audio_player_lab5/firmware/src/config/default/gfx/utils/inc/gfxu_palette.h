  Summary:
    Describes a palette asset.  A palette is a lookup table for unique colors.
    Given in an index, a color can be retrieved.
    
    header - standard asset header
    colorCount - the number of colors contained in the palette
    colorMode - the color mode of the image

/* Function:
    GFX_Result GFXU_PaletteGetColor(void);

  Summary:
    Gets a color from a palette asset given an index value.
     
  Parameters:
    GFXU_PaletteAsset* pal - pointer to the palette to read
    uint32_t idx - the index of the color to look up
    GFXU_MemoryIntf* read_cb - a pointer to a memory interface to use for
                               memory operations, not needed for internal
                               assets
    GFXU_ExternalAssetReader** reader - will return as a valid pointer if
                          the palette asset is located in an external source.
                          If this is the case then the caller is responsible
                          for servicing the external asset reader state
                          machine until completion.  The caller is then
                          responsible for freeing the reader's memory.
  Returns:
    GFX_Color - the color that was retrieved
