MPLAB Harmony v3 "gfx" repository (revision v3.7.0) has MHC Code Generation issue for PIC32 SSD driver.
This project(snake_game) has been created using the patch (in folder "gfx_ssd_driver_patch")
discussed in the following steps.

1. After reconfigure or regenerating the project (snake_game), you may see build errors. Apply the patch by following below steps
    a. Copy and paste "drv_gfx_ssd1963.c" and "drv_gfx_ssd1963.h" from 
       "your_downloaded_folder/pic32mz_ef_curiosity_v2/snake_game/drv_gfx_ssd1963.c" and "your_downloaded_folder/pic32mz_ef_curiosity_v2/snake_game/drv_gfx_ssd1963.h" to
       "your_project_path/apps/pic32mz_ef_curiosity_v2/snake_game/firmware/src/config/default/gfx/driver/controller/ssd1963"
       
Note: 
1. The exisiting demo application (snake_game) builds and works without the application of the patch discussed above.
   The patch needs to be applied only if you wish to reconfigure or regenerate the existing demo application. 
2. Future MPLAB Harmony v3 "gfx" repository is expected to have the have the MHC Code Generation issue for PIC32 SSD driver.
   Once the feature is supported, Please check the release notes of the Harmony v3 "gfx" repository you are using. If the
   MHC Code Generation issue for PIC32 SSD driver is fixed, you need not apply this patch to reconfigure or regenerate
   the existing demo application.
