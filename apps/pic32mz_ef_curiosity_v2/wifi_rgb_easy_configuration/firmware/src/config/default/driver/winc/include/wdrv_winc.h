    Other API's are provided in other header files, specifically:
      assoc       - Current association.
      bssfind     - BSS scan functionality.
      custie      - Custom IE management for Soft-AP.
      nvm         - Off line access the WINC SPI flash.
      powersave   - Power save control.
      socket      - TCP/IP sockets.
      softap      - Soft-AP mode.
      sta         - Infrastructure stations mode.
      systtime    - System time.
