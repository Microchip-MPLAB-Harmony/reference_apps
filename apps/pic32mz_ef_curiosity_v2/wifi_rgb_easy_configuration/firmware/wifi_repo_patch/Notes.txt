MPLAB Harmony v3 "wireless" repository (revision v3.2.0) doesn't fully support winc driver for PIC32 devices. 
This project(wifi_rgb_easy_configuration_demo) has been created using the patch (in folder "wifi_repo_patch") 
discussed in the following steps.

1. After reconfigure or regenerating the project (wifi_rgb_easy_configuration_demo), you may see build errors. Apply the patch by following below steps
    a. Copy and paste "wdrv_winc_spi.c" from 
       "your_downloaded_folder\wifi_rgb_easy_configuration\wifi_repo_patch\wdrv_winc_spi.c" to 
       "your_project_path\wifi_rgb_easy_configuration\firmware\src\config\default\driver\winc\dev\spi\wdrv_winc_spi.c"       
    b. After regeneration remove/delete generated "mpfs_img2.c" file from the project before building.
       
Note: 
1. The exisiting demo application (wifi_rgb_easy_configuration_demo) builds and works without the application of the patch discussed above.
   The patch needs to be applied only if you wish to reconfigure or regenerate the existing demo application. 
2. Future MPLAB Harmony v3 "wireless" repository is expected to have the winc driver support for PIC32 devices. 
   Once the feature is supported, Please check the release notes of the Harmony v3 wireless repository you are using. If the 
   winc driver for PIC32 devices is supported, you need not apply this patch to reconfigure or regenerate 
   the existing demo application.
