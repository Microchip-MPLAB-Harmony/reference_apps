# WiFi based RGB LED Control Application on Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board
<h2 align="center"> <a href="https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/reference_apps/releases/latest/download/wifi_rgb_easy_configuration.zip" > Download </a> </h2>

-----
## Description:

>  The WiFi RGB Easy Configuration demo showcases how to configure an embedded WiFi device that does not have a
    natural keyboard and screen. By using the internal Web server that accompanies the Microchip TCP/IP stack,
    end-users can use their browser to control the RGB(RedGreenBlue) Led.

> The Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board provides an XPRO connector. The XPRO connector is plugged with the
    ATWINC1500-XPRO board to configure WiFi connectivity. Also, the demo features changing the color of the on-board
    RGB LED using the webpage hosted by the Curiosity board.

## Hardware Used:

- [Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320209)   
- [ATWINC1500-XPRO](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/ATWINC1500-XPRO)


## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:</span>  

Refer [Project Manifest](./firmware/src/config/default/harmony-manifest-success.yml) present in harmony-manifest-success.yml under the project folder *firmware/src/config/default*  
- Refer the [Release Notes](../../../release_notes.md#development-tools) to know the **MPLAB X IDE** and **MCC** Plugin version. Alternatively, [Click Here](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/reference_apps/blob/master/release_notes.md#development-tools)   

<span style="color:blue"> Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with. </span> To download original version of MPLAB Harmony v3 packages, refer to document [How to Use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Project Manifest Feature](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/How-to-Use-the-MPLAB-Harmony-v3-Project-Manifest-Feature-DS90003305.pdf)

**Note:** : This demo uses wireless WINC v19.6.1 stack and driver.

## Setup:
 - Connect ATWINC1500-XPRO to Extension header (J501) on Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board
 - Power the Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board from a Host PC through a Type-A male to micro-B USB cable connected to Micro-B port (J700)

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps.  

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "PIC32MZ2048EFM144"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (wifi_rgb_easy_configuration\firmware\pic32mz_ef_curiosity_v2.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "Curiosity/Starter Kits PKOB4" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Navigate to "../reference_apps/apps/pic32mz_ef_curiosity_v2/wifi_rgb_easy_configuration/firmware/src/utilities" folder
- Double click on "mpfs2" jar file (Note : Make sure java is installed)
- Select Source Directory and browse to the folder ""../reference_apps/apps/pic32mz_ef_curiosity_v2/wifi_rgb_easy_configuration/firmware/src/web_pages" as shown in below image
- Select "PIC32 Image" and click on **Generate** button to generate mpfs_img2.c file as shown in below image  
	<img src = "images/mpfs.png" align="middle">
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo:
- Open Tera Term, connect to serial console. If there is any connection issue on tera terminal, unplug the USB cable connected to Micro-B port, and reconnect it back.
- Change the baud rate to 115200
- Perform a reset by pressing the "RESET" switch
- The serial terminal displays the below message  
"TCP/IP Stack: Initialization Started  
TCP/IP Stack: Initialization Ended - success  
SYS_Initialize: The MPFS2 File System is mounted  
WINC IP Address: 192.168.1.1"  
- When the demonstration runs, the WINC1500 goes into SoftAP mode (it behaves as an access point) and displays itself as "MCHPSoftAP" network		
- From a smartphone or personal computer, connect to the "MCHPSoftAP" network, which is the SoftAP network started by the demonstration. Then, bring up a web page by entering the IP address(e.g., 192.168.1.1) of the SoftAP network into the smartphone browser
- When the web page is displayed, On the right top corner of the page, there is a widget through which you can change the color of the RGB LED on the Curiosity board
- Click the text box to display a pop-up for selecting the color of the RGB LED. Click the Submit button to set the color of the RGB LED on the Curiosity board


## Comments:
- This application demo builds and works out of box by following the instructions above in "Running the Demo" section. If you need to enhance/customize this application demo, you need to use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Software framework. Refer links below to setup and build your applications using MPLAB Harmony.
