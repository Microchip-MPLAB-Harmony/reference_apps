MPLAB Harmony v3 "audio" repository (revision v3.4.0) is known to have an issue for PIC32 devices.
The Harmony audio I2S driver converts byte count (from the application) to a word count for the 
audio DMA interface. This project(sdcard_player) has been created using the patch (in folder "core_repo_patch") 
discussed in the following steps.

1. To reconfigure or regenerate the project (sdcard_player), Apply the patch by following below steps
    a. Close the project and Harmony 3 configurator before applying the patch.
    b. Make sure your "audio" repository is intact with revision v3.4.0.
    c. Copy and paste "diskio.c" from 
       "your_downloaded_folder\sdcard_player\core_repo_patch" to 
       "your_harmony_repo\core\system\fs\fat_fs\src\hardware_access"
    d. Copy and paste "drv_sdspi.c.ftl" from 
       "your_downloaded_folder\sdcard_player\core_repo_patch" to 
       "your_harmony_repo\core\driver\sdspi\async\src"
    e. Copy and paste "drv_sdspi_local.h.ftl" from 
       "your_downloaded_folder\sdcard_player\core_repo_patch" to 
       "your_harmony_repo\core\driver\sdspi\async\src"      
    f. Now, you can open the project in MPLAB X IDE, Launch Harmony 3 configurator and reconfigure/regenerate.

       
Note: 
1. The existing demo application (sdcard_player) builds and works without the application of the patch discussed above.
   The patch needs to be applied only if you wish to reconfigure or regenerate the existing demo application. 
2. Future MPLAB Harmony v3 "audio" repository is expected to have the Audio I2S driver issue fixed for PIC32 devices. 
   Once the issue is fixed, please check the release notes of the Harmony v3 audio repository you are using. If the 
   issue is fixed in the Audio I2S driver for PIC32 devices, you need not apply this patch to reconfigure or regenerate 
   the existing demo application.
