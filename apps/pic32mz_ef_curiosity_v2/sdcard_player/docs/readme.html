<h1 id="sd-card-audio-player-application-on-curiosity-pic32mz-ef-2-0-development-board">SD Card Audio Player Application on Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board</h1>
<hr>
<h2 id="description-">Description:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>   The demonstration application creates an audio player that reads audio files
     (.WAV format only) from an SD card mounted on the click interface. The audio
     is played through the CODEC placed on the X32 header interface. It also provides
     feature to switch to the next track on the media.    </p>
<p>   The sdcard_player application plays .wav files from the SD Card. The SD Card
     driver uses the SPI driver to interact with the SD Card. The application uses
     the File System Service to read/write data on the SD Card. The audio data read
     from the SD card is decoded by passing it to the WAV decoder. The decoded output
     is saved in the output buffers 1 and 2 which are used in ping pong manner. The
     output buffers 1 and 2 are submitted to the Codec driver for playing.
     The Codec is configured for 16-bit data and 48 kHz sampling frequency.
     The Codec driver sends the audio data to the AK4954 Codec using the I2S driver,
     which in turn uses DMA to transfer the audio data. The Codec driver uses the
     I2C driver to send commands to the AK4954 Codec.</p>

<h2 id="comments-">Comments:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Known Issue - For PIC32, the Harmony audio I2S driver converts byte count (from the application) to a word
count for the audio DMA interface. Since, the PIC32 DMA requires the count in bytes, the application is
worked around to multiply the byte count by 2 so as to nullify the driver issue. In the application file
&quot;app_sdcard_audio_task.c&quot;, the API call DRV_CODEC_BufferAddWrite multiplies the bufferSize parameter by 2
This issue is expected to be fixed in Harmony Audio repository release v3.5.0.
If you are using Harmony Audio repository release v3.5.0, please read the release notes to verify the fix
and undo the work around mentioned above</li>
