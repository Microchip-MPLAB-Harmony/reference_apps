## Description:
> This application demonstrates a thermal camera based object heat map. The application senses the surface temperature of an object and display it as a colorful heat map. Temperatures are rendered in real-time and displayed as different colors to form a heat map.  
The application uses MPLAB Harmony v3 Legato Graphics library to display on OLED C click, the thermal frame data measured with Grid-EYE click. The application have two major tasks: one to acquire and process the data from the Grid-EYE click and the other one to display a frame of colors based on the temperature values measured at the previous task.

## Modules/Technology Used:
- Legato Grahpics library
- TIME System Service
- I2C driver
- SPI driver
- LE External Controller driver
- Core Timer

## Hardware Used:
- [Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320209)   
- [OLED C click](https://www.mikroe.com/oled-c-click)
- [Grid-EYE click](https://www.mikroe.com/grid-eye-click)


## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:</span>  

Refer [Project Manifest](./firmware/src/config/default/harmony-manifest-success.yml) present in harmony-manifest-success.yml under the project folder *firmware/src/config/default*  
- Refer the [Release Notes](../../../release_notes.md#development-tools) to know the **MPLAB X IDE** and **MHC/MCC** Plugin version.  

<span style="color:blue"> Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with. </span> To download original version of MPLAB Harmony v3 packages, refer to document [How to Use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Project Manifest Feature](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/How-to-Use-the-MPLAB-Harmony-v3-Project-Manifest-Feature-DS90003305.pdf)

## Setup:
- Mount the OLED C click on the mikro BUS 1 of the Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board
- Mount the Grid-EYE click on the mikro BUS 2 of the Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board
- Power the Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board from a Host PC through a Type-A male to micro-B USB cable connected to Micro-B port (J700)

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps.  

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "PIC32MZ2048EFM144"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below


## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (pic32mzef_thermal_camera_heat_map/firmware/pic32mz_ef_curiosity_v2.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "Curiosity/Starter Kits PKOB4" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below


## Running the Demo:
- Reset or power cycle the device.
- After the board powers up, the MPLAB Harmony Logo should appear and remain on the screen for 2 seconds. After the time elapsed, the screen should change, showing small rectangles with different colors
- Place a finger above the sensor, and on display, the user can observe a figure of the finger  in a color different than the background (red or orange)
