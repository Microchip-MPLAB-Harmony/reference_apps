MPLAB Harmony v3 "usb" repository (revision v3.6.1) doesn't have full support for USB MSD with Multiple Drives. 
This project(msd_multiple_luns) has been created using the patch (in folder "usb_repo_patch") 
discussed in the following steps.

1. To reconfigure or regenerate the project (msd_multiple_luns), Apply the patch by following below steps
    a. Close the project and Harmony 3 configurator before applying the patch.
    b. Make sure your "usb" repository is intact with revision v3.6.1.
    c. Copy and paste "module.py" from 
       "your_downloaded_folder\msd_multiple_luns\usb_repo_patch\module.py" to 
       "your_harmony_repo\usb\config\module.py"
    d. now, you can open the project in MPLAB X IDE, Launch Harmony 3 configurator and reconfigure/regenerate.
       
Note: 
1. The exisiting demo application (msd_multiple_luns) builds and works without the application of the patch discussed above.
   The patch needs to be applied only if you wish to reconfigure or regenerate the existing demo application. 
2. Future MPLAB Harmony v3 "usb" repository is expected to have the USB MSD with Multiple Drives full feature supported. 
   Once the feature is supported, Please check the release notes of the Harmony v3 USB repository you are using. If the 
   USB MSD with Multiple Drives feature is supported, you need not apply this patch to reconfigure or regenerate 
   the existing demo application.
3. MSD Function driver should be configured manually to add multiple LUNS in MSD Function Driver configuraation window.
