# BLE Fitness Tracker Application on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano and Nano Base for Click boards
<h2 style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://github.com/MicrochipTech/MPLAB-Harmony-Reference-Apps/releases/latest/download/ble_fitness_tracker.zip" > Download </a> </h2>

## Description:
> The application demonstrates a solution based on Microchip products for the health care industry
  and wearable products. The application displays heart rate readings (in beats per minute - bpm)
  on a very low power consuming display and posts this Heart Rate data to Microchip Bluetooth Data (MBD)
  android mobile application via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).  


> The Mikro Elektronika Heart Rate 3 click board is used to read the heart pulse.
  Mikroelektronika eINK click bundle is used for displaying heart rate.
  The eINK click bundle contains the eINK click adapter board and the eINK display. BM71
  Bluetooth module is used to send the heart rate data over BLE.

> The Heart Rate 3 click contains two integrated LEDs, a photosensitive element and an advanced low noise analog front end to provide clean and accurate heart rate readings. It is enough to place
  an index finger on top of the sensor to get the heart rate via the I2C interface.

> The eINK display is a very low power consumption display and it can retain the information,
  even after disconnecting from the power source. The host MCU SAM E51 is interfaced with the Heart Rate 3 click over the I2C interface and eINK click over SPI Interface.

## Running the Demo:
<span style="color:blue"> *Before proceeding, install the Microchip Bluetooth Data android app in an Android Smartphone.* </span>
- Enable Bluetooth and location from Smartphone settings
- Perform reset by unplugging and re-plugging the power cable of SAM E51 Curiosity Nano
- Parallelly, open the "**Microchip Bluetooth Data (MBD)**" android app from your smartphone
  and tap on "Bluetooth Smart" icon on the dashboard. If prompted, allow the application to turn on Bluetooth.  
<img src = "images/mbd_appscreen1.jpg" width="250" height="450" align="middle">

- After power-up, the application displays the Microchip logo on the eINK display and initializes the heart rate sensor
- After successful initialization of the heart rate sensor, two integrated LEDs on the heart rate 3 click lights up

-  Now, scan for Bluetooth devices by tapping START SCAN option on the MBD APP.
  The BM71 device should appear as **MCHP_SAM_E51_HR** in the list of Bluetooth devices.  
<img src = "images/mbd_appscreen2.jpg" width="250" height="450" align="middle">

- Stop the scan and connect the **MCHP BLE device** by clicking on **MCHP_SAM_E51_HR**.
  This will establish a connection between the MBD BLE application and the BM71 BLE device.

  **Note**: Make sure smartphone screens are not turned off and don't switch to any other App(s) on your smartphone.
- The heart rate value (in bpm - beats per minute) gets displayed on the **Sensor Loaction** screen as shown
  in the figure below. Also, the same heart rate value gets displayed on the eINK display.  
<img src = "images/mbd_appscreen8.jpg" width="250" height="450" align="middle">

### Running the Demo without BLE:
#### Note: To test the demo without BLE, disconnect the BM71-XPRO from EXT 1 connector of the Curiosity Nano Base board.
- Perform reset by unplugging and re-plugging the power cable of SAM E51 Curiosity Nano
