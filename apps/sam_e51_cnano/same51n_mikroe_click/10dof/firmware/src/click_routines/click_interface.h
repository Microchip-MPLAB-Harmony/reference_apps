/**	Click routine interfaces/resources Macro Declarations
 *
 * 	1. I2C
 *  The 10dof click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano uses
 *  mikroBUS socket #1 on the Curiosity Nano Base for Click boards
 *  to mount 10dof click board. The I2C lines from MCU coming to
 *  this socket are from SERCOM2 peripheral on the MCU.
 *
 * 2. Timer
 *  The 10dof click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano uses
 *  Systick timer module on the MCU to implement the time
 *  requirement of 10dof click routines.
