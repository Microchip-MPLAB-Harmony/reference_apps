/**	Click routine interfaces/resources Macro Declarations
 *
 * 	1. USART
 *  The heartrate9 click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano uses
 *  mikroBUS socket #1 on the Curiosity Nano Base for Click boards
 *  to mount heartrate9 click board. The USART lines from MCU coming to
 *  this socket are from SERCOM4 peripheral on the MCU.
 *
 * 2. Timer
 *  The heartrate9 click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano uses
 *  Systick timer module on the MCU to implement the time
 *  requirement of heartrate9 click routines.
