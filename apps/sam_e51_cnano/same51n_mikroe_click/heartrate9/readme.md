	<img src = "images/heartrate9_click_run.png" width="660" height="340" align="middle">
- For every switch press, the SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit prints the Heart Rate.  

## Instructions to add Heart Rate functionality to your application:

You could use this demonstration as an example to add Heart Rate functionality to your MPLAB Harmony v3 based application. Follow the below steps.  
1. If you haven't downloaded the Heart Rate 9 demo yet [Click Here](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/MPLAB-Harmony-Reference-Apps/releases/latest/download/heartrate9.zip) to download, otherwise go to next step  
2. Unzip the downloaded .zip file  
3. From the unzipped folder heartrate9/firmware/src, copy the folder **click_routines** to the folder firmware/src under your MPLAB Harmony v3 application project  
4. Open MPLAB X IDE  
5. Open your application project  
6. In the project explorer, Right click on folder **Header Files**  
   and add a sub folder **click_routines** by selecting "Add Existing Items from Folders..."  
	 <img src = "images/header_add.png">  

- Click on "Add Folder..." button  
	<img src = "images/header_add2.png">  

- Select the "click_routines" folder and select "Files of Types" as Header Files  
	<img src = "images/header_add3.png">

- Click on "Add" button to add the selected folder  
	<img src = "images/header_add4.png">

- The Heart Rate 9 click example header files gets added to your project  
	<img src = "images/header_add5.png">

7. In the project explorer, Right click on folder **Source Files**  
   and add a sub folder **click_routines** by selecting "Add Existing Items from Folders..."   
	 <img src = "images/source_add.png">  

 - Click on "Add Folder..." button  
 	<img src = "images/source_add2.png">  

 - Select the "click_routines" folder and select "Files of Types" as Source Files  
 	<img src = "images/source_add3.png">

 - Click on "Add" button to add the selected folder  
 	<img src = "images/source_add4.png">

 - The Heart Rate 9 click example source files gets added to your project  
 	<img src = "images/source_add5.png">

8. The Heart Rate 9 click example uses the **USART** and **Timer** peripherals. The configuration of these peripherals for your application depends on the 32-bit MCU and development board you are using.

	- **Configure USART**:
 		- Add the USART peripheral block to the MHC project graph  
		- Configure USART Pins using MHC Pin configuration Window  
		The USART configuration depends on
 			- 32-bit MCU
 			- 32-bit MCU development board
 			- The socket on which you have mounted the Heart Rate 9 click board  
 		*Example: The Heart Rate 9 click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses mikroBUS socket #1 on the Curiosity Nano Base for Click boards to mount the Heart Rate 9 click board. The USART lines from MCU coming to this socket are from the SERCOM4 peripheral on the MCU.*  
		*MHC Project Graph - USART configuration*  
		<img src = "images/usart_config.png">  

		*MHC Pin Configurator - USART pin configuration*  
		<img src = "images/usart_pins.png">  

	- **Configure Heart Rate 9 Click Reset Pin**:
 		- Configure Heart Rate 9 Click Reset Pin using MHC Pin configuration Window  
		The Reset Pin configuration depends on
 			- The socket on which you have mounted the Heart Rate 9 click board  
 		*Example: The Heart Rate 9 click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses mikroBUS socket #1 on the Curiosity Nano Base for Click boards to mount the Heart Rate 9 click board. The Reset Pin line from the Heart Rate 9 Click coming to this socket is PA07 on the MCU.*  
		*MHC Pin Configurator - Reset pin configuration*  
		<img src = "images/heartrate9_click_reset_pin.png">  

	- **Configure Timer**:
		- Configure Timer peripheral block in the MHC project graph  
		The Timer configuration depends on
 			- 32-bit MCU  
		*Example: The Heart Rate 9 click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses SysTick timer module on the MCU to implement the time requirement of Heart Rate 9 click routines.*  
		*MHC Project Graph - SysTick configuration*  
		<img src = "images/systick_configure.png">  

	- **Map Generic Macros**:
		- After generating the project, following the above configuration, map the generic macros used in the click routines to the Harmony PLIB APIs of the 32-bit MCU your project is running on
		- The generic macros should be mapped in the header file click_interface.h  

			<img src = "images/click_inter.png">  			
		*Example: The Heart Rate 9 click routines for the example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses the following Harmony PLIB APIs*  			
		<img src = "images/map_click.png">

		**Note:** Define the value of **CLICK_HEARTRATE9_USART_READ_BUFFER_SIZE** same as **USART_READ_BUFFER_SIZE** defined in the respective USART PLIB '.c' file

9. The **click_routines** folder contain an example C source file **heartrate9_example.c**. You could use **heartrate9_example.c** as a reference to add Heart Rate 9 functionality to your application.
