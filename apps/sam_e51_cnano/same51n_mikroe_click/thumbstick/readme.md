- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "ATSAME51J20A"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below


## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (sam_e51_cnano/same51n_mikroe_click/thumbstick/firmware/sam_e51_cnano.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "PKOB nano" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo:
- Open the Tera Term terminal application on your PC (from the Windows® Start menu by pressing the Start button)
- Set the baud rate to 115200
- A message is printed on the terminal whenever Thumbstick's push button pressed or UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT Thumbstick's 360 degree rotation is made.

## Instructions to add Thumbstick functionality to your application:

You could use this demonstration as an example to add Thumbstick functionality to your MPLAB Harmony v3 based application. Follow the below steps.  
1. If you haven't downloaded the Thumbstick demo yet [Click Here](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/MPLAB-Harmony-Reference-Apps/releases/latest/download/thumbstick.zip) to download, otherwise go to next step  
2. Unzip the downloaded .zip file  
3. From the unzipped folder thumbstick/firmware/src, copy the folder **click_routines** to the folder firmware/src under your MPLAB Harmony v3 application project  
4. Open MPLAB X IDE  
5. Open your application project  
6. In the project explorer, Right click on folder **Header Files**  
   and add a sub folder **click_routines** by selecting "Add Existing Items from Folders..."  
	 <img src = "images/header_add.png">  

- Click on "Add Folder..." button  
	<img src = "images/header_add2.png">  

- Select the "click_routines" folder and select "Files of Types" as Header Files  
	<img src = "images/header_add3.png">

- Click on "Add" button to add the selected folder  
	<img src = "images/header_add4.png">

- The Thumbstick click example header files gets added to your project  
	<img src = "images/click_inter.png">

7. In the project explorer, Right click on folder **Source Files**  
   and add a sub folder **click_routines** by selecting "Add Existing Items from Folders..."   
	 <img src = "images/source_add.png">  

 - Click on "Add Folder..." button  
 	<img src = "images/source_add2.png">  

 - Select the "click_routines" folder and select "Files of Types" as Source Files  
 	<img src = "images/source_add3.png">

 - Click on "Add" button to add the selected folder  
 	<img src = "images/source_add4.png">

 - The Thumbstick click example source files gets added to your project  
 	<img src = "images/click_routines.png">

8. The Thumbstick click example uses the **SPI**, **Timer** peripherals and **PORT** Pins. The configuration of these peripherals for your application depends on the 32-bit MCU and development board you are using.
	- **Configure SPI**:
 		- Add the SPI peripheral block to the MHC project graph  
		- Configure SPI Pins using MHC Pin configuration Window  
		The SPI configuration depends on
 			- 32-bit MCU
 			- 32-bit MCU development board
 			- The socket on which you have mounted the Thumbstick click board  
 		*Example: The Thumbstick click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses mikroBUS socket #1 on the Curiosity Nano Base for Click boards to mount the Thumbstick click board. The SPI lines from MCU coming to this socket are from the SERCOM1 peripheral on the MCU.*  
		*MHC Project Graph - SPI configuration*  
		<img src = "images/thumbstick_spi_config.png" width="750" height="298" align="middle">  

		*MHC Pin Configurator - SPI pin configuration*  
		<img src = "images/thumbstick_spi_pins_config.png" width="750" height="78" align="middle">  

	- **Configure Thumbstick Push Button**:
 		- Add the EIC peripheral block to the MHC project graph  
		- Configure EIC Pins using MHC Pin configuration Window  
		The EIC configuration depends on
 			- 32-bit MCU
 			- 32-bit MCU development board
 			- The socket on which you have mounted the Thumbstick click board  
 		*Example: The Thumbstick click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses mikroBUS socket #1 on the Curiosity Nano Base for Click boards to mount the Thumbstick click board. The PA04 EIC line coming to this socket from MCU needs to be configured for the Thumbstick's push button INT pin to work.*  
		*MHC Project Graph - EIC configuration*  
		<img src = "images/thumbstick_eic_config.png" width="750" height="380" align="middle">  

		*MHC Pin Configurator - EIC pin configuration*  
		<img src = "images/thumbstick_eic_pin_config.png" width="750" height="19" align="middle">  

	- **Configure Timer**:
		- Configure Timer peripheral block in the MHC project graph  
		The Timer configuration depends on
 			- 32-bit MCU  
		*Example: The Thumbstick click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses SysTick timer module on the MCU to implement the time requirement of Thumbstick click routines.*  
		*MHC Project Graph - SysTick configuration*  
		<img src = "images/thumbstick_systick_configure.png" width="528" height="333" align="middle">  

	- **Map Generic Macros**:
		- After generating the project, following the above configuration, map the generic macros used in the click routines to the Harmony PLIB APIs of the 32-bit MCU your project is running on
		- The generic macros should be mapped in the header file click_interface.h  

			<img src = "images/click_inter.png">  			
		*Example: The Thumbstick click routines for the example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses the following Harmony PLIB APIs*  			
		<img src = "images/map_click.png">

9. The **click_routines** folder contain an example C source file **thumbstick_example.c**. You could use **thumbstick_example.c** as a reference to add Thumbstick functionality to your application.
