# Serial Bridge Application to upgrade ATWINC1510 Firmware and Google Cloud IoT Provisioning

## Description:

> This application acts as a serial bridge between the PC utility (gcp_iot_winc_provisioning) and the ATWINC1510 module on WiFi 7 click board.
The application interfaces with the PC over UART and with the WiFi 7 click (ATWINC1510 module) board over the SPI lines.  

> The application receives the ATWINC1510 firmware and Google cloud root certificate bundle from the PC, and programs it into the ATWINC1510 module (on WiFi 7 click board).  

## Modules/Technology Used:

- Peripheral Modules
	- EIC
  - SPI
  - USART
  - Serial bridge
  - WINC

## Hardware Used:
  - [SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/EV76S68A)

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "ATSAME51J20A"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on "Next" button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on "Finish" button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime.
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (gcp_iot_provisioning_serial_bridge/firmware/sam_e51_cnano.X) in MPLAB X IDE.
- Ensure "PKOB nano" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application.
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar.
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below.

## Running the Demo
- Ensure the board is powered on (a USB cable is connected to the DEBUG USB port)
- Refer the **"Running the Demo"** section in the documentation under utilities/[readme](../readme.md) file

## Comments:
- This application demo builds and works out of box by following the instructions above in "Running the Demo" section. If you need to enhance/customize this application demo, you need to use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Software framework. Refer links below to setup and build your applications using MPLAB Harmony.
