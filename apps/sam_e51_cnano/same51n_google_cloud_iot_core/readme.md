## Description:

> This application demonstrates the implementation of an IoT sensor node on the Google cloud platform.
The demo is developed on the SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit connected with Curiosity Nano Base.
The SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit is based on SAM E51 microcontroller, is a small and easily expandable demonstration and development platform for applications.

> Typical IoT application development problem can be partitioned into three blocks:  
	-	Smart (Application logic): Implemented through the ATSAME51 microcontroller  
	-	Security: Implemented through the ATECC608 secure element  
	-	Connectivity: Implemented through the ATWINC1510 WiFi controller module

>This application utilizes Mikroelektronika click interface and Microchip XPRO interfaces available on Curiosity Nano base to create a Google IoT node application. The application demonstrates MQTT data transfer of light and temperature sensor data to Google IoT cloud.
