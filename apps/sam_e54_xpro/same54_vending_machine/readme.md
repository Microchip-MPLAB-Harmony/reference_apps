## Description:
The application implements an embedded network application to update and track drinks status of a Vending Machine (VM).
- The SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit will act as a HTTP-Server to keep track of the items in the Vending Machine.
- The HTTP-Client (PC web page) talks to the HTTP-server and displays the status of the Vending Machine.
- The OLED1 Xplained Pro extension kit will act man machine interface (MMI) to select and confirm drinks with buttons (up/down and select) and an OLED displays VM information.
  - The VM application uses Button 1 (Down) and Button 2 (Up) to scroll through the VM items and Button 3 to select an item from the Vending Machine.
  - The LEDs above the button indicates a button press with a blink.
  - The OLED (128 x 32) is used to display the drink name and their corresponding number of the items in a Vending Machine.
  - When Button 3 (Select) is pressed the HTTP-Server will decrement the count of an item and updates the HTTPClient(Web page) through ethernet interface.
- When a Bay of a VM is empty it sends out a message to a specific TCP server.

<span style="color:blue"> *Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with.* </span>

## Setup:
- Connect the OLED1 Xplained Pro extension kit to Extension Header 1 (EXT1) on the SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit
- Establish a connection between the router/switch with the SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit through the RJ45 connector. Make sure your PC is connected to the same router/switch.
- Connect the micro USB cable from the computer to the DEBUG USB connect on the SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "ATSAME54P20A"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on "Next" button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on "Finish" button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime.
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (same54_vending_machine\firmware\sam_e54_xpro.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "EDBG" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo:
- Open the Tera Term terminal application on your PC, select the virtual COM port of SAM E54 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit, and change the baud rate to 115200
- You should see the text on the OLED screen in series like the screens below:
  <img src = "images/result_oled.png" width="519" height="69" align="middle">
- You should see demo information and IP address (after DHCP success) in Tera Term terminal, as shown below:
  <img src = "images/result_terminal.png" width="721" height="282" align="middle">
- Open a web browser and enter the HTTP- Server IP address (e.g. http://192.168.1.101) that you got on the tera term in the previous step. Click on the 'Vending Machine' tab to see the page for the Vending Machine Demo.

  <img src = "images/result_webpage.png" width="637" height="535" align="middle">
- Use the Button 1 and Button 2 on the OLED1 Xplained Pro to scroll through the items of the Vending
Machine. Use the Button 3 on the OLED to pick an item from the VM. The count of the corresponding item on the OLED screen will be decremented by 1 and is reflected on the Web page as well as on the OLED screen.

    <img src = "images/result_webpage_oled.png" width="806" height="218" align="middle">
- Run Hercules SETUP utility, and start TCP Server to listen on Port 80
    <img src = "images/result_tcp_server.png" width="620" height="140" align="middle">
  - Note: you need to update source code in app.c to fill your PC's IP address that running this TCP Server
- Press the select Button 3 and make one or more item to zero count. After few second, you will see this screen to notice bay empty (e.g. item 1. coca-cola).

    <img src = "images/result_bay_empty.png" width="697" height="113" align="middle">
- In 'Vending Machine' webpage, you can pick an **ITEM** and change the **COUNT** to a new number, then press **UPDATE** to confirm.
