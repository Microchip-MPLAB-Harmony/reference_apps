## Description

This application demonstrates usage of the internal Hardware Security Module (HSM) of the PIC32CX SG61 for securely transferring application firmware between Host and Client over a CAN bus

The package contains two projects:
   - pic32cx_sg61_secure_can_host
		> Signs and encrypts a test application firmware. The encrypted firmware and  is sent over CAN interface to the client node
   - pic32cx_sg61_secure_can_node_bootloader
        > Receives the encrypted application firmware on a temporary RAM buffer, decrypts and verifies the signature. Up on successfull verification, the firmware is programmed to the device flash.
		   A device reset is triggered automatically, and the received test application starts executing after the reset.

### Loading Test application firmware:

The pic32cx_sg61_secure_can_host project in this release already has a LED blinking test application Hex array included -> [image_pattern_hex_pic32cx_sg61_cultra.h](./firmware/pic32cx_sg61_secure_can_host/firmware/src/image_pattern_hex_pic32cx_sg61_cultra.h)

 To use any application other than this

- Generate binary file for the application referring to [Application Configurations](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/bootloader_apps_can/blob/master/docs/GUID-DBAD37CB-BA5E-414D-A3EC-AA6555B345EA.md)

- Convert binary to a C style array containing Hex output. The [Binary to C Array script](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/bootloader_apps_can/blob/master/docs/GUID-AA3E00A3-26EF-40CA-8811-8E1D00F4C227.md) can be used to perform this. The output Hex header file from this can be included directly to the secure_can_host project and compiled.

## Hardware Used:

- [PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV09H35A)

## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:</span>  

Refer [Project Manifest](./firmware/pic32cx_sg61_secure_can_host/firmware/src/config/pic32cxsg61_cultra_can_host/harmony-manifest-success.yml) present in harmony-manifest-success.yml under the project folder *firmware/src/config/default*  
- Refer the [Release Notes](../../../release_notes.md#development-tools) to know the **MPLAB X IDE** and **MCC** Plugin version. Alternatively, [Click Here](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/reference_apps/blob/master/release_notes.md#development-tools).
- Any Serial Terminal application like Tera Term terminal application.

<span style="color:blue"> Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with. </span> To download original version of MPLAB Harmony v3 packages, refer to document [How to Use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Project Manifest Feature](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/How-to-Use-the-MPLAB-Harmony-v3-Project-Manifest-Feature-DS90003305.pdf)

## Hardware Setup:
-   [PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV09H35A) is used for both **Host Development kit** and **Client Node Development kit**
   
    <img src = "images/Setup.png">

-   Connect PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation board to another PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation board as per the pin connections shown below

    |PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation board - 1|PIC32CX SG61 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation board - 2|
    |--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
    |CANH, CAN0|CANH, CAN0|
    |CANL, CAN0|CANL, CAN0|
    |GND, CAN0|GND, CAN0
    | |

-   Connect the Debug USB port on the evaluation boards to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Demo:

1. Open a Terminal application \(Ex.:Tera Term\) on the computer and configure the serial port settings for **Host Development kit** as follows:

    -   Baud : 115200

    -   Data : 8 Bits

    -   Parity : None

    -   Stop : 1 Bit

    -   Flow Control : None
    
    Open another instance of the terminal and configure it with the same settings as above, for the **Client Node Development kit**.

2.  Open the host application project *\pic32cx_sg61_secure_can_host\firmware\pic32cx_sg61_secure_can_host.X* in the IDE

3.  Build and program the firmware using the IDE on to the Host development kit

    -   You should see the following output in the console corresponding to the   **Host Development kit**
    <img src = "images/Host_Output1.jpg">


4.   Open the bootloader project *pic32cx_sg61_secure_bootloader\firmware\pic32cx_sg61_secure_can_node_bootloader\firmware\pic32cx_sg61_secure_can_node_bootloader.X* in the IDE

5.  Build and program the application using the IDE on to the **Client Node development kit**

    -   **LED1** will be turned-on to indicate that bootloader code is running on the target
    -   You should also be able to see the following output in the console corresponding to the **Client Node development kit**
    <img src = "images/Target_Output1.jpg">

6.  Press the Switch **SW1** on the Host development kit to trigger programming of the application binary

7.  Once the programming is complete,

    -   **LED1** on the Host development kit will be turned on indicating success

    -   The Client Node development kit will be automatically reset. Upon re-start, the boot-loader will jump to the user application

    -   If the test application is programmed then **LED1** should start blinking
    
    - The below output can be seen on the respective consoles of the **Host and Client development kit** 
	>Host
    
    >    <img src = "images/Host_Output2.jpg">
        
	 
	
	>Client Node
        
    >    <img src = "images/Target_Output2.jpg">

6.  Press and hold the Switch **SW1** to trigger Bootloader from test application and you should see below output

    <img src = "images/Target_Output3.jpg">

7.  Press Reset button on the Host development kit followed by **SW1** to reprogram the application binary
