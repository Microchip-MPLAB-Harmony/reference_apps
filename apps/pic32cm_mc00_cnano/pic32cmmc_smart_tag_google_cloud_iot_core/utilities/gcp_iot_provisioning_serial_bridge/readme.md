# Serial Bridge Application to upgrade ATWINC1510 Firmware and Google Cloud IoT Provisioning

## Description:

> This application acts as a serial bridge between the PC utility (gcp_iot_winc_provisioning) and the ATWINC1510 module on WiFi 7 click board.
The application interfaces with the PC over UART and with the WiFi 7 click (ATWINC1510 module) board over the SPI lines.  

> The application receives the ATWINC1510 firmware and Google cloud root certificate bundle from the PC, and programs it into the ATWINC1510 module (on WiFi 7 click board).  

## Modules/Technology Used:

## Hardware Used:
  - [PIC32CM MC00 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/EV10N93A)
  - [Curiosity Nano Base for Click Boards](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/AC164162)
  - [WIFI 7 CLICK](https://www.mikroe.com/wifi-7-click)

## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:</span>  

 - [MPLAB X IDE v5.50](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)  
 - [MPLAB XC32 Compiler v3.0](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers)

 <span style="color:blue"> *Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with.* </span>  

## Setup:
- Mount PIC32CM MC00 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit on "CNANO56_HOST_CONN"(U3) connector of Curiosity Nano Base board
- Mount WiFi 7 Click board on mikroBUS click 1 connector of Curiosity Nano Base board
- Connect a USB cable to the DEBUG USB port for programming

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file in "gcp_iot_provisioning_serial_bridge/hex" folder.
- Select Device has "PIC32CM1216MC00032"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on "Next" button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on "Finish" button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime.
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo
- Ensure the board is powered on (a USB cable is connected to the DEBUG USB port)
- Refer the **"Running the Demo"** section in the documentation under utility/[readme](../readme.md) file
