# ATWINC1510 Firmware upgrade and Google Cloud IoT Provisioning (Root certificate upgrade) Guide

## Description:

> The SAM-IoT WG Development Application uses ATWINC1510-MR210PB IEEE 802.11 b/g/n module to enable cloud connectivity. The application's functioning requires the ATWINC1510 module to have firmware compatible with the WiFi software stack running on the SAM-IoT microcontroller. To enable this compatibility, the  ATWINC1510 module is updated with the firmware compatible with WiFi software running in the latest released demo.  

> The root certificates to identify the IoT node to the Google cloud platform are programmed in the non-volatile memory of the ATWINC1510 module.

## <span style="color:blue"> *Complete the above highlighted step before proceeding further* </span>

## Running the utility
- Download and extract [gcp_iot_winc_provisioning](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/MPLAB-Harmony-Reference-Apps/releases/latest/download/gcp_iot_winc_provisioning.zip
) into utilities folder
- Open command prompt and navigate to **"utilities/gcp_iot_winc_provisioning"**
- The following command line will generate a device programming file winc1500_19.7.3.prog.

  **image_tool.exe -c winc1500_19.7.3\config.txt -o winc1500_19.7.3.prog -of prog**  

- The file produced can be used to upgrade a WINC1500 to version 19.7.3 including the firmware, HTTP files and root
certificates.
- The following command line will program a WINC1500 device via the serial port   
    **winc_programmer -p COM29 -d winc1500 -i winc1500_19.7.3.prog -if prog -w -r -pfw winc1500_19.7.3\firmware\programmer_release_3A0.bin**

    **NOTE** : Respective device COM PORT should be selected in above command and all other serial terminal application should be closed
- Wait till **verify passed** message comes up as shown below
