  Parameters:
    handle           - Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_WINC_Open.
    pBSSCtx          - Pointer to BSS context.
    pAuthCtx         - Pointer to authentication context.
    pfNotifyCallback - Pointer to notification callback function.

  Returns:
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_OK              - The request has been accepted.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_NOT_OPEN        - The driver instance is not open.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_INVALID_ARG     - The parameters were incorrect.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR   - The request to the WINC was rejected.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_INVALID_CONTEXT - The BSS context is not valid.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_CONNECT_FAIL    - The connection has failed.
