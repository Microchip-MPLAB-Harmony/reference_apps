/*  Combined IPv4/Ethernet Address

  Summary:
    A structure containing both an IPv4 and Ethernet address.

  Description:
    An IPv4 stored as a 32 bit number and an Ethernet address.

  Remarks:
    The top 8 bits of the IPv4 32 bit representation corresponds to
      the last byte of the IPv4 address, i.e. 192.168.0.1 = 0x0100A8C0

/*  Association Information Callback.

  Summary:
    Pointer to a callback to provide information about the current association.

  Description:
    This data type defines a function callback to provide details of the SSID,
      network address, authentication type and initial signal strength (RSSI) of the
      current association.

  Parameters:
    handle          - Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_WINC_Open.
    pSSID           - Pointer to current SSID.
    pPeerAddress    - Pointer to the peer devices address.

  Summary:
    Retrieve the current association SSID.

  Description:
    Attempts to retrieve the SSID of the current association.

  Precondition:
    WDRV_WINC_Initialize should have been called.
    WDRV_WINC_Open should have been called to obtain a valid handle.
    A peer device needs to be connected and associated.

  Parameters:
    handle              - Client handle obtained by a call to WDRV_WINC_Open.
    pSSID               - Pointer to buffer to receive the SSID if available.
    pfAssociationInfoCB - Pointer to callback function to be used when SSID
                            is available.

  Returns:
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_OK             - pSSID will contain the SSID.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_NOT_OPEN       - The driver instance is not open.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_INVALID_ARG    - The parameters were incorrect.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_REQUEST_ERROR  - The request to the WINC was rejected
                                            or there is no current association.
    WDRV_WINC_STATUS_RETRY_REQUEST  - The SSID is not available but it will be
                                            requested from the WINC.

  Remarks:
    If the SSID is not currently known to the driver (stored within the
      WINC) a request will be sent to the WINC and the return status
      will be WDRV_WINC_STATUS_RETRY_REQUEST. The callback function
      pfAssociationInfoCB can be provided which will be called when the WINC
      provides the association information to the driver. Alternatively the caller
      may poll this function until the return status is WDRV_WINC_STATUS_OK
      to obtain the SSID in pSSID.
