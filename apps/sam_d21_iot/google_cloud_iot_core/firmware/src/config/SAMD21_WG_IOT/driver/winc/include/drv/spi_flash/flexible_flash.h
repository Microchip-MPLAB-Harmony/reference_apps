 * @param [in]  u16EntryIDToLookFor
 *                  The ID of the location in Flash we are looking for. See @ref tenuFlashLUTEntryID.
 * @param [in]  pu32StartOffset
 *                  Pointer to the variable where the Flash section start address should be stored.
 * @param [in]  pu32Size
 *                  Pointer to the variable where the Flash section size should be stored.
 * @warning
 *              In case there is a running WINC firmware, it is required to pause the firmware
 *              first before any trial to access SPI flash to avoid any racing between host and
 *              running firmware on bus. @ref m2m_wifi_download_mode can be used to pause the firmware.
 * @sa          m2m_wifi_download_mode
 *              m2m_wifi_init_hold
 * @return      The function returns @ref M2M_SUCCESS for successful operations and a negative value otherwise.
