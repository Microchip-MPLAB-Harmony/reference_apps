# XDMAC with QSPI Application on SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit
-----

## Description:

> This application demonstrates the usage of Extended Direct Memory Access Controller (XDMAC) with QSPI on Cortex-M7 based MCU (SAM E70).
  The application writes and reads 80KB data into the External Serial Flash memory using the QSPI, with and without using XDMAC.


## Modules/Technology Used:

- Peripheral Modules
	- EFC
	- MPU
	- QSPI
	- XDMAC
	- SYSTICK

## Hardware Used:

- [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320113) 
- Logic Analyzer or Oscilloscope  

## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> *This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:*</span>  
 - [MPLAB Harmony v3 "csp" repo v3.6.1](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp/releases/tag/v3.6.1)
 - [MPLAB Harmony v3 "dev_packs" repo v3.6.1](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/dev_packs/releases/tag/v3.6.1)
 - [MPLAB Harmony v3 "mhc" repo v3.3.5](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/mhc/releases/tag/v3.3.5)
 - MPLAB Harmony Configurator Plugin v3.4.2 
 - [MPLAB X IDE v5.35](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
 - [MPLAB XC32 Compiler v2.40](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers)
 - [MPLAB X IPE v5.35](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-integrated-programming-environment)
 - Any Serial Terminal application like Tera Term terminal application.  
 <span style="color:blue"> *Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with.* </span>


## Setup:
- Connect the micro USB to the Host computer
- Connect the Saleae Logic Analyzer and establish a connection with the Host PC
- Configure the four channels to measure the QSPI throughput as follows
	- Channel 0 is PA19, which is configured to Set and Clear the pin before and after the QSPI Write without DMA
	- Channel 1 is PB2, which is configured to Set and Clear the pin before and after the QSPI Read without DMA
	- Channel 2 is PC31, which is configured to Set and Clear the pin before and after the QSPI Write with DMA
	- Channel 3 is PB3, which is configured to Set and Clear the pin before and after the QSPI Read with DMA

## Programming binary/hex file:
- If you are not interested in installing development tools. The pre-built binary/hex file can be programmed to the target
	### Steps to program the hex file using MPLAB X IPE
	- Open MPLAB X IPE
	- Select Device has "ATSAME70Q21B"
	- Power the SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit from a Host PC through a Type-A male to Micro-B USB cable connected to Micro-B port
	- Once Power cable is connected, "EDBG" hardware tool is identified as a programmer
	- Browse to hex file (qspi_xdmac_read_write_hex_file.hex)
	- Click on program button. The device gets programmed in sometime
	- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (qspi_xdmac_read_write_hex_file\firmware\sam_e70_xult.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "EDBG" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo:
- Start capturing samples using the Logic Analyzer Software
- Reset the hardware to start the application run from the beginning
- Stop capturing the sample in the Logic Analyzer Software
- Verify the the above mentioned four GPIO Pin waveforms and timestamps to see the QSPI performance with and without using the XDMAC for the following cases
	- Write 80KB of data to external serial Flash without using the DMA
	- Read 80KB of data from the external serial Flash without using the DMA
	- Write 80KB of data to external serial Flash using the DMA
	- Read 80KB of data from the external serial Flash using the DMA
