# XDMAC with QSPI Application on SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit
-----

## Description:

> This application demonstrates the usage of Direct Memory Access Controller (XDMAC) with QSPI on Cortex-M7 based MCU (SAM E70).
  The application writes and reads 80KB data into the External Serial Flash memory using the QSPI, with and without using XDMAC.


## Modules/Technology Used:

- Peripheral Modules
	- EFC
	- MPU
	- QSPI
	- XDMAC
	- SYSTICK

## Hardware Used:

- [SAM E70 Xplained Ultra Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320113)
- Logic Analyzer or Oscilloscope

## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> *This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:*</span>
- [MPLAB Harmony v3 "csp" repo v3.8.3](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp/releases/tag/v3.8.3)
- [MPLAB Harmony v3 "core" repo v3.8.1](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/core/releases/tag/v3.8.1)
- [MPLAB Harmony v3 "mhc" repo v3.6.5](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/mhc/releases/tag/v3.6.5)
- [MPLAB Harmony v3 "dev_packs" repo v3.8.0](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/dev_packs/releases/tag/v3.8.0)
- MPLAB Harmony 3 Launcher Plugin v3.6.2
- [MPLAB X IDE v5.45](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)
- [MPLAB XC32 Compiler v2.41](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers)
- Any Serial Terminal application like Tera Term terminal application.

<span style="color:blue"> *Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with.* </span>


## Setup:
- Connect the micro USB to the Host computer
- Connect the Saleae Logic Analyzer and establish a connection with the Host PC
- Configure the four channels to measure the QSPI throughput as follows
	- Channel 0 is PA19, which is configured to Set and Clear the pin before and after the QSPI Write without DMA
	- Channel 1 is PB2, which is configured to Set and Clear the pin before and after the QSPI Read without DMA
	- Channel 2 is PC31, which is configured to Set and Clear the pin before and after the QSPI Write with DMA
	- Channel 3 is PB3, which is configured to Set and Clear the pin before and after the QSPI Read with DMA

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps.

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "ATSAME70Q21B"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (qspi_xdmac_read_write/firmware/sam_e70_xult.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "EDBG" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo:
- Start capturing samples using the Logic Analyzer Software
- Reset the hardware to start the application run from the beginning
- Stop capturing the sample in the Logic Analyzer Software
- Verify the the above mentioned four GPIO Pin waveforms and timestamps to see the QSPI performance with and without using the XDMAC for the following cases
	- Write 80KB of data to external serial Flash without using the DMA
	- Read 80KB of data from the external serial Flash without using the DMA
	- Write 80KB of data to external serial Flash using the DMA
	- Read 80KB of data from the external serial Flash using the DMA
