## Description


> This application demonstrates the anti-cloning feature on the PIC32CM LS60 microcontroller (MCU). The application has three projects pertaining to Secure and Non-Secure modes of PIC32CM LS60 that work between the Host and Client devices (PIC32CM LS60/LE00) and offers security isolation between the trusted and the non-trusted resources in the device.

- The application includes host and client projects.

- **PIC32CM LS60 Host application:**
    - The host project initiates the symmetric authentication process of the client connected to it. The host also connects to the AWS IoT cloud. Once the SW0 button on the host device is pressed, the random number from the inbuilt ATECC608B is sent across the USART pins to the client and awaits the result. Once the client is authenticated, the sensor data is received and displayed on the MIKROE OLED C Click board. The data is also published to the AWS IoT Core at timely intervals. The LED0 on the host toggles each time the data is published to the cloud. The host's connection to the PIC32CM LS60 client would be successful as the authentication (through the ATECC608B) would be successful. However, the PIC32CM LE00 client would fail the authentication process as there is no inbuilt ATECC608B. If the authentication fails, the data is not displayed on the host side or published to the cloud.

- **PIC32CM LS60 Client application:**
    - The PIC32CM LS60 Client reads the sensor data from the temperature and light sensors on the I/O1 Xplained Pro board connected to the EXT2 Xpro connector. The client waits for the host to initiate the authentication process. Once the authentication is completed successfully, the sensor data is sent to the host through the USART. The MAC calculation and SERCOM transmission are placed securely in the secure region of the PIC32CM LS60.

- **PIC32CM LE00 Client application:**
    - The PIC32CM LE00 Client reads the sensor data from the temperature and light sensors on the I/O1 Xplained Pro board connected to the EXT2 XPRO connector. The client waits for the host to initiate the authentication process. Since the authentication fails, the sensor data is not sent across the host through USART.

- The MIKROE OLED C Click board doesn't display any value yet
- Press **SW0** on the PIC32CM LS60 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit to start the authentication process
- The **LED(LED1) will be on if there is no active WiFi connection. Once the certificate verification is done, follw the steps in section [Wi-Fi configuration through CLI](#Wi-Fi_CLI) to enter the WiFi credentials.
- Once WiFi and MQTT connection is successful, the **LED1** will be **Off** and **LED0** will be **On**
- Once authentication is successful, the MIKROE OLED C Click will display the sensor values and the cloud will be updated with the sensor values periodically
- An **LED (LED0)** on the PIC32CM LS60 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit toggles every time the sensor values are published
