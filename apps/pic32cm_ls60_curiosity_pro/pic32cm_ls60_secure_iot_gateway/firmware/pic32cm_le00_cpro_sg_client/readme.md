## Description:

> This  project demonstrates the bad/fake/impersonating client side implementation of the secure IoT gateway application.

> The PIC32CM LE00 Client reads the sensor data from the temperature and light sensors on the I/O1 Xplained Pro board connected to the EXT2 XPRO connector. The sensor data is displayed at the MIKROE OLED C Click display. The client waits for the host to initiate the authentication process. Since the authentication fails, the sensor data is not sent across the host through USART.

## Modules/Technology Used:
- Peripheral Modules
    - SERCOM1 (I2C-ATECC608)
    - SERCOM2 (USART)
    - SERCOM3 (SPI)

    - TC0
    - RTC
    - NVMCTRL
    - EVSYS
    - Systick
    - EIC
    - GPIO
    - ADC
    - PM
- Harmony Core
- Drivers
    - SPI
    - LE SPI 4-line
    - Crypto
- System Services
    - Console
    - Time
    - Input
    - CryptoAuthlib
        - Core
        - Trust&Go
- Graphics
    - GFX Core Legato

## Hardware Used:

- [PIC32CM LE00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV80P12A)
- [I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATIO1-XPRO)
- [MIKROE OLED C Click](https://www.mikroe.com/oled-c-click)


## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:</span>  

Refer [Project Manifest](./firmware/src/config/pic321e_oled/harmony-manifest-success.yml) present in harmony-manifest-success.yml under the project folder *firmware/src/config/pic321e_oled*  

- Refer the [Release Notes](../../../../../release_notes.md#development-tools) to know the **MPLAB X IDE** and **MCC** Plugin version. Alternatively, [Click Here](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/reference_apps/blob/master/release_notes.md#development-tools).

<span style="color:blue"> Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with. </span> To download original version of MPLAB Harmony v3 packages, refer to document [How to Use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Project Manifest Feature](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/How-to-Use-the-MPLAB-Harmony-v3-Project-Manifest-Feature-DS90003305.pdf)

## Hardware Setup:
- Connect the MIKROE OLED C Click to the mikroBUS extension in the PIC32CM LE00 Curiosity Pro board
- Connect the I/O1 Xplained Pro Extension Kit to the EXT2 in the PIC32CM LE00 Curiosity Pro board
- Connect the jumper wires from **PA22/PA23** for SERCCOM UART RX/TX to communicate with the client
- Connect the PIC32CM LE00 Curiosity Pro Evaluation Kit to the Host PC as a USB Device through a Type-A male to micro-B USB cable connected to Micro-B USB (Debug USB) port

#### Demo Setup
For complete "Secure IoT Gateway application" demo setup, refer to demo [readme.md](../../readme.md)

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps.  

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "PIC32CM5164LE60100"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in [Running the Demo](#Running_Demo) section below


## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (pic32cm_ls60_secure_iot_gateway/firmware/pic32cm_le00_cpro_sg_client) in MPLAB X IDE
- Open pic32cm_le00_securegateway_client as the main project.
- Ensure "PIC32CM LE00 Curiosity Xpro" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "Make and Program Device" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in [Running the Demo](#Running_Demo) section below

## Running the Demo: <span id="Running_Demo"><span>
- Once the device is programmed, the I/O1 Xplained Pro sensor values will be read and displayed in the MIKROE OLED C Click display board.
- The client does not respond to the authentication request as it doesnt have an secure element to compute and respond
- On the host side, the display on OLED C board indicates unsuccessful authentication
