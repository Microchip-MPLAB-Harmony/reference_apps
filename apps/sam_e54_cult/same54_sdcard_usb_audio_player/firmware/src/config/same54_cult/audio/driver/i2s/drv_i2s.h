/* I2S Driver Buffer Handle

  Summary:
    Handle identifying a read or write buffer passed to the driver.

  Description:
    A buffer handle value is returned by a call to the DRV_I2S_ReadBufferAdd
    or DRV_I2S_WriteBufferAdd functions. This handle is associated with the
    buffer passed into the function and it allows the application to track the
    completion of the data from (or into) that buffer.  The buffer handle value
    returned from the "buffer add" function is returned back to the client
    by the "event handler callback" function registered with the driver.

    The buffer handle assigned to a client request expires when the client has
    been notified of the completion of the buffer transfer (after event handler
    function that notifies the client returns) or after the buffer has been
    retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

  Remarks:
    None

/* I2S Driver Buffer Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary
    Pointer to a I2S Driver Buffer Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the I2S driver
    buffer event handling callback function. A client must register a pointer
    using the buffer event handling function whose function signature (parameter
    and return value types) match the types specified by this function pointer
    in order to receive buffer related event calls back from the driver.

    The parameters and return values are described here and
    a partial example implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event - Identifies the type of event

    bufferHandle - Handle identifying the buffer to which the vent relates

    context - Value identifying the context of the application that
    registered the event handling function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyBufferEventHandler( DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT event,
                                   DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle,
                                   uintptr_t context )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer.
                break;

            case DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE, it means that the data was
    transferred successfully.

    If the event is DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR, it means that the data was not
    transferred successfully. The DRV_I2S_BufferCompletedBytesGet function can
    be called to find out how many bytes were processed.

    The bufferHandle parameter contains the buffer handle of the buffer that
    associated with the event. And bufferHandle will be valid while the buffer
    request is in the queue and during callback, unless an error occurred.
    After callback returns, the driver will retire the buffer handle.

    The context parameter contains the a handle to the client context,
    provided at the time the event handling function was registered using the
    DRV_I2S_BufferEventHandlerSet function.  This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the buffer add request.

    The event handler function executes in the peripheral's interrupt
    context when the driver is configured for interrupt mode operation. It is
    recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or blocking
    operations with in this function.

    The DRV_I2S_ReadBufferAdd and DRV_I2S_WriteBufferAdd functions can
    be called in the event handler to add a buffer to the driver queue. These
    functions can only be called to add buffers to the driver whose event
    handler is running. For example, I2S2 driver buffers cannot be added in
    I2S1 driver event handler.

  Summary:
    Initializes the I2S instance for the specified driver index.

  Description:
    This routine initializes the I2S driver instance for the specified driver
    index, making it ready for clients to open and use it. The initialization
    data is specified by the init parameter. The initialization may fail if the
    number of driver objects allocated are insufficient or if the specified
    driver instance is already initialized. The driver instance index is
    independent of the I2S module ID. For example, driver instance 0 can be
    assigned to I2S2.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    index - Identifier for the instance to be initialized

    init - Pointer to the init data structure containing any data necessary to
    initialize the driver.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver instance object.
    Otherwise, returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Summary:
    Opens the specified I2S driver instance and returns a handle to it.

  Description:
    This routine opens the specified I2S driver instance and provides a
    handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to
    identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent
    parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.

    Specifying a DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE will cause the driver to provide
    exclusive access to this client. The driver cannot be opened by any
    other client.

  Precondition:
    Function DRV_I2S_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    index - Identifier for the object instance to be opened

    intent - Zero or more of the values from the enumeration DRV_IO_INTENT
    "ORed" together to indicate the intended useof the driver.
    See function description for details.

  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a number
    identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. Error can occur
    - if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_I2S_CLIENTS_NUMBER is
      insufficient.
    - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened
      exclusively by another client.
    - if the driver peripheral instance being opened is not initialized or is
      invalid.
    - if the client is trying to open the driver exclusively, but has already
      been opened in a non exclusive mode by another client.
    - if the driver is not ready to be opened, typically when the initialize
      routine has not completed execution.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;

    handle = DRV_I2S_Open(DRV_I2S_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE);
    if (DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle)

        // Unable to open the driver
        // May be the driver is not initialized or the initialization
        // is not complete.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_I2S_Close routine is called.
    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the requested intent
    flags are not supported, the routine will return DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. This

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify a buffer event handling function for the driver
    to call back when queued buffer transfers have finished.

  Description:
    This function allows a client to register a buffer event handling function
    with the driver to call back when queued buffer transfers have finished.
    When a client calls either the DRV_I2S_ReadBufferAdd or
    DRV_I2S_WriteBufferAdd function, it is provided with a handle identifying
    the buffer that was added to the driver's buffer queue.  The driver will
    pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler" function when
    the buffer transfer has completed.

    The event handler should be set before the client performs any "buffer add"
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which
    could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    DRV_I2S_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open
    routine.

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function.

    context - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
    unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called.  It can be used to
    identify any client specific data object that identifies the instance of the
    client module (for example, it may be a pointer to the client module's state
    structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;

    uint8_t mybuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle;

    // myI2SHandle is the handle returned

        &bufferHandle);

    if(DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID == bufferHandle)
    {
        // Error handling here
    }

    // Event is received when the buffer is processed.

    void APP_I2SBufferEventHandler(DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT event,
            DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE handle, uintptr_t context)
    {
        // The context handle was set to an application specific
        // object. It is now retrievable easily in the event handler.
        MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj = (MY_APP_OBJ *) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE:
                // This means the data was transferred.
                break;

            default:
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the client does not want to be notified when the queued buffer transfer
    has completed, it does not need to register a callback. This function is
    thread safe when called in a RTOS application.

    modified.  On returning, the bufferHandle parameter may be
    DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID for the following reasons:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read-only
    - if the buffer size is 0
    - if the transmit queue is full or the queue depth is insufficient

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the buffer was
    processed successfully or a DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the buffer
    was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    DRV_I2S_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle - Handle of the communication channel as return by the
    DRV_I2S_Open function.

    buffer - Data to be transmitted.

    size - Buffer size in bytes.

    bufferHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return
    buffer handle.

  Returns:
    The bufferHandle parameter will contain the return buffer handle. This will
    be DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID if the function was not successful.

  Example:
    <code>

    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;
    uint8_t mybuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle;

    // myI2SHandle is the handle returned
    // by the DRV_I2S_Open function.

    {
        // Error handling here
    }

    // Event is received when
    // the buffer is processed.

  Summary:
    Queues a write/read operation.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write-read operation. The function
    returns with a valid buffer handle in the bufferHandle argument if the
    write-read request was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request
    to the hardware instance queue and returns immediately. While the request is
    in the queue, the application buffer is owned by the driver and should not
    be modified. The function returns DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the client opened the driver for read only or write only
    - if the buffer size is 0
    - if the queue is full or the queue depth is insufficient
    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver,
    the driver will issue a DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully of DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the
    buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    DRV_I2S_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle - Handle of the communication channel as return by the
    DRV_I2S_Open function.

    transmitBuffer - Data to be transmitted.

    receiveBuffer - Will hold data that is received.

    size - Buffer size in bytes (same for both buffers)

    bufferHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return
    buffer handle.

  Returns:
    The bufferHandle parameter will contain the return buffer handle. This will
    be DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID if the function was not successful.

  Remarks:
    This function is thread safe in a RTOS application. It can be called from
    within the I2S Driver Buffer Event Handler that is registered by this
    client. It should not be called in the event handler associated with another
    I2S driver instance. It should not otherwise be called directly in an ISR.

    This function is useful when there is valid read expected for every

  Summary:
    Queues a read operation.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking read operation. The function returns
    with a valid buffer handle in the bufferHandle argument if the read request
    was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request to the hardware
    instance receive queue and returns immediately. While the request is in the
    queue, the application buffer is owned by the driver and should not be
    modified. The function returns DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID in the
    bufferHandle argument:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the buffer size is 0
    - if the read queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient.
    - if the driver handle is invalid

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the buffer was
    processed successfully of DRV_I2S_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the buffer
    was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    DRV_I2S_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle - Handle of the communication channel as returned by the
    DRV_I2S_Open function.

    buffer - Buffer where the received data will be stored.

    size - Buffer size in bytes.

    bufferHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return
    buffer handle.

  Returns:
     The buffer handle is returned in the bufferHandle argument. This is
     DRV_I2S_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not successful.

  Example:
    <code>

    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;
    uint8_t mybuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
