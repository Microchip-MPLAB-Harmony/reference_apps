/* WM8904 Driver Buffer Handle

  Summary:
    Handle identifying a write buffer passed to the driver.

  Description:
    A buffer handle value is returned by a call to the DRV_WM8904_BufferAddWrite()
    or DRV_WM8904_BufferAddRead() function. This handle is associated with the 
    buffer passed into the function and it allows the application to track the 
    completion of the data from (or into) that buffer.
 
    The buffer handle value returned from the "buffer add" function is returned 
    back to the client by the "event handler callback" function registered with
    the driver.

    The buffer handle assigned to a client request expires when the client has
    been notified of the completion of the buffer transfer (after event handler
    function that notifies the client returns) or after the buffer has been
    retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

/* WM8904 Driver Buffer Event Handler Function
  Summary:
    Pointer to a WM8904 Driver Buffer Event handler function

  Description:
    This data type defines the required function signature for the WM8904 driver
    buffer event handling callback function. A client must register a pointer
    to a buffer event handling function who's function signature (parameter
    and return value types) match the types specified by this function pointer
    in order to receive buffer related event calls back from the driver.

    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event

    bufferHandle    - Handle identifying the buffer to which the event relates

    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that registered
                      the event handling function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MyBufferEventHandler( DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT event,
                                   DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle,
                                   uintptr_t context )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE:
                // Handle the completed buffer.
            break;

            case DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR:
            default:
                // Handle error.
            break;
        }
    }
    </code>

   Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE, this means that the data
    was transferred successfully.

    If the event is DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR, this means that the data was
    not transferred successfully. The bufferHandle parameter contains the buffer
    handle of the buffer that failed. The DRV_WM8904_BufferProcessedSizeGet()
    function can be called to find out how many bytes were processed.

    The bufferHandle parameter contains the buffer handle of the buffer that
    associated with the event.

    The context parameter contains a handle to the client context,
    provided at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_WM8904_BufferEventHandlerSet function.  This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the buffer add request.

    The buffer handle in bufferHandle expires after this event handler exits. In
    that the buffer object that was allocated is deallocated by the driver
    after the event handler exits.

    The event handler function executes in the data driver(i2S) peripheral's
    interrupt context when the driver is configured for interrupt mode operation.
    It is recommended of the application to not perform process intensive or
    blocking operations with in this function.

    DRV_WM8904_BufferAddWrite function can be called in the event handler
    to add a buffer to the driver queue.

/* WM8904 Driver Command Event Handler Function

  Summary:
    Pointer to a WM8904 Driver Command Event Handler Function

  Description:
    This data type defines the required function signature for the WM8904 driver
    command event handling callback function.

    A command is a control instruction to the WM8904 Codec.
    Example Mute ON/OFF, Zero Detect Enable/Disable etc.

    A client must register a pointer to a command event handling function who's
    function signature (parameter and return value types) match the types
    specified by this function pointer in order to receive command related event
    calls back from the driver.

    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that 
                      registered the event handling function.

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_WM8904CommandEventHandler( uintptr_t context )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;

        // Last Submitted command is completed.
        // Perform further processing here
    }
    </code>

   Remarks:

    The occurrence of this call back means that the last control command was
    transferred successfully.

    The context parameter contains a handle to the client context,
    provided at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_WM8904_CommandEventHandlerSet function.  This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the buffer add request.

    The event handler function executes in the control data driver
    interrupt context. It is recommended of the application to not perform
    process intensive or blocking operations with in this function.

    The DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING and DRV_IO_INTENT_NONBLOCKING ioIntent
    options are not relevant to this driver. All the data transfer functions
    of this driver are non blocking.

    WM8904 can be opened with DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE, or DRV_IO_INTENT_READ or
    DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITEREAD io_intent option.  This decides whether the driver
    is used for headphone output, or microphone input or both modes simultaneously.

    Function DRV_WM8904_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex    - Identifier for the object instance to be opened

    ioIntent    - Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                  DRV_IO_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use
                  of the driver. See function description for details.

  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a number
    identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID. Error can occur
    - if the number of client objects allocated via DRV_WM8904_CLIENTS_NUMBER is
      insufficient.
    - if the client is trying to open the driver but driver has been opened 
      exclusively by another client.
    - if the driver hardware instance being opened is not initialized or is invalid.
    - if the ioIntent options passed are not relevant to this driver.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;

    handle = DRV_WM8904_Open(DRV_WM8904_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITEREAD | DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE);
    if (DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle)
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
        // May be the driver is not initialized or the initialization
        // is not complete.
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_WM8904_Close routine is called.
    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware.If the requested intent
    flags are not supported, the routine will return DRV_HANDLE_INVALID.  This
    function is thread safe in a RTOS application. It should not be called in an
    ISR.

/* Function:
    void DRV_WM8904_Close( DRV_Handle handle )

  Summary:
    Closes an opened-instance of the WM8904 driver

  Description:
    This routine closes an opened-instance of the WM8904 driver, invalidating the
    handle. Any buffers in the driver queue that were submitted by this client
    will be removed.  After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle"
    must not be used with any of the remaining driver routines.  A new handle must
    be obtained by calling DRV_WM8904_Open before the caller may use the driver
    again

  Precondition:
    The DRV_WM8904_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    WM8904 driver instance.

    DRV_WM8904_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
                 - None

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;  // Returned from DRV_WM8904_Open

    DRV_WM8904_Close(handle);

    </code>

  Remarks:

    Usually there is no need for the driver client to verify that the Close
    operation has completed.  The driver will abort any ongoing operations
    when this routine is called.

  Summary:
    Schedule a non-blocking driver write operation.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking write operation. The function returns
    with a valid buffer handle in the bufferHandle argument if the write request
    was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request to the hardware
    instance transmit queue and returns immediately. While the request is in the
    queue, the application buffer is owned by the driver and should not be
    modified.  The function returns DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID:
    - if a buffer could not be allocated to the request
    - if the input buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the buffer size is 0.
    - if the queue is full or the queue depth is insufficient
    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver,
    the driver will issue a DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE event if the buffer
    was processed successfully of DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR event if the
    buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_WM8904_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    WM8904 device instance and the DRV_WM8904_Status must have returned
    SYS_STATUS_READY.

    DRV_WM8904_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

    DRV_IO_INTENT_WRITE must have been specified in the DRV_WM8904_Open call.

  Parameters:
    handle       - Handle of the WM8904 instance as return by the
                   DRV_WM8904_Open function.
    buffer       - Data to be transmitted.
    size         - Buffer size in bytes.
    bufferHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the
                   return buffer handle.

  Returns:
    The bufferHandle parameter will contain the return buffer handle. This will be
    DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID if the function was not successful.

    The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler"
    function when the buffer transfer has completed.

    The event handler should be set before the client performs any "buffer add"
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which
    could be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_WM8904_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    WM8904 driver instance.

    DRV_WM8904_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine
    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function.
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called.  It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example,
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;
    uint8_t mybuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
    DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle;

    // myWM8904Handle is the handle returned
    // by the DRV_WM8904_Open function.

    // Client registers an event handler with driver

    DRV_WM8904_BufferEventHandlerSet(myWM8904Handle,
                    APP_WM8904BufferEventHandler, (uintptr_t)&myAppObj);

    DRV_WM8904_BufferAddWrite(myWM8904handle, &bufferHandle
                                        myBuffer, MY_BUFFER_SIZE);

    if(DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_HANDLE_INVALID == bufferHandle)
    {
        // Error handling here
    }

    // Event is received when
    // the buffer is processed.

    void APP_WM8904BufferEventHandler(DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT event,
            DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_HANDLE bufferHandle, uintptr_t contextHandle)
    {
        // contextHandle points to myAppObj.

        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT_COMPLETE:

                // This means the data was transferred.
                break;

            case DRV_WM8904_BUFFER_EVENT_ERROR:

                // Error handling here.

            default:
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the client does not want to be notified when the queued buffer transfer
    has completed, it does not need to register a callback.

    as well as normalizes the volume range to a more audible dB range. 
    The current driver implementation assumes that all dB values under -60 dB are
    inaudible to the human ear.

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function.
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called.  It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that
