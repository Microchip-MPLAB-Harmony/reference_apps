/* I2S Driver Buffer Handle Macros

  Summary:
    I2S driver Buffer Handle Macros

  Description:
    Buffer handle related utility macros. I2S driver buffer handle is a
    combination of buffer token and the buffer object index. The token
    is a 16 bit number that is incremented for every new read or write request
    and is used along with the buffer object index to generate a new buffer
    handle for every request.

  Remarks:
    None
