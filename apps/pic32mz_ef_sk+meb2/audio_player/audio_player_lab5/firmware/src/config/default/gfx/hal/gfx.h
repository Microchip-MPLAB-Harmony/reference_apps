/* Function:
    GFX_Result GFX_Set(GFX_Flag flag, ...);

  Summary:
    Abstract state data modification interface.
    
  Description:
    This function is a generic data 'setter' function.  Its first argument is
    always a flag from the 'GFX_Flag's table.  The flag indicates the
    desired operation to perform.  Operations will often require additional
    arguments to be passed to the function.
    
    Below is a table describing the function of each flag and its 
    associated arguments:
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_BRIGHTNESS, uint32_t);
    Sets the current display brightness setting.  Must be in the range provided
    by GFXF_BRIGHTNESS_RANGE.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_VSYNC_CALLBACK, GFX_SyncCallback_FnPtr);
    sets the function pointer that a driver may call to indicate that it has
    entered VSYNC state.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_HSYNC_CALLBACK, GFX_SyncCallback_FnPtr);
    Sets the function pointer that a driver may call to indicate that it has
    entered HSYNC state.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_ORIENTATION, GFX_Orientation);
    Sets the orientation mode for a given context.  Raster operation points
    are orthogonally rotated by a right angle multiple in the display space.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_MIRRORED, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the mirroring mode for a given context.  Raster operation points
    are mirrored to the opposite X coordinate in relative space.
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_COLOR_MODE, GFX_COLOR_MODE);
    Sets the global context color mode.  This operation may trigger a
    reallocation of all existing layer buffers to properly contain
    the new pixel sizes.
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_GLOBAL_PALETTE, GFX_GlobalPalette);
    Sets the global palette pointer for the context.  Drivers can use this
    lookup table to upscale colors to a higher bit depth while taking
    advantage of lower frame buffer sizes.  Should be used in conjunction
    with an 8-bit color mode.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_ACTIVE, uint32_t);
    Sets the active layer index.  All subsequent layer operations will be
    performed on the active layer.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_ENABLED, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the active layer enabled state.  This might mean that a hardware
    layer needs to be enabled by the graphics controller.  Drivers may
    need this to manage hardware features.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_VISIBLE, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the active layer visible state.  This might mean that a hardware
    layer needs to be set to visible by the graphics controller.  Drivers
    may need this to manage hardware features.
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_INVALID, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the active layer invalid state.  This indicates that there are
    pending changes to the layer that will happen in the future.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_VSYNC, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the vsync swap mode of the active layer.  Only relevant for 
    multi-buffer layers.  In this mode the driver becomes responsible for
    managing the layer swap chain and should perform layer swapping during
    its VSYNC period.  If this option is off, the layer swaps immediately
    upon request.
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_SWAP_SYNC, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the layer sync mode for a given context.  Layer syncing ensures
    that all dirty layers will swap at the same time rather than
    individually as needed.
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_SWAP);
    Indicates that the active layer should advance its swap chain to the
    next valid state.  This is typically done after performing raster
    operations.  If GFXF_LAYER_VSYNC is off then the swap happens
    immediately.  Otherwise it happens at the drivers discretion which
    is most likely during its next VSYNC period.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_POSITION, uint32_t, uint32_t);
    Sets the X and Y coordinate of the active layer.  Arguments are x and y.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_SIZE, uint32_t, uint32_t);
    Sets the width and height of the active layer. Arguments are width
    and height.  Changing the size of the layer may cause all frame buffers
    owned by that layer to be reallocated.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_ALPHA_ENABLE, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the layer-based alpha blending state for the active layer. This is
    mainly a hardware feature and must be supported by the graphics driver.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_ALPHA_AMOUNT, uint32_t);
    Sets the layer-based alpha blending amount of the active layer. This is
    mainly a hardware feature and must be supported by the graphics driver.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_MASK_ENABLE, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the layer-based masking state for the active layer. This is mainly
    a hardware feature and must be supported by the graphics driver.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_MASK_COLOR, GFX_Color);
    Sets the layer-based masking color for the active layer. This is mainly
    a hardware feature and must be supported by the graphics driver.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_BUFFER_COUNT, uint32_t);
    Sets the buffer count for the active layer.  Drivers may restrict
    this value.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_BUFFER_ADDRESS, GFX_BUFFER);
    Sets the pixel data address for a buffer of the active layer.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_BUFFER_COHERENT, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the coherent allocation flag for a buffer of the active layer.
    Coherent buffers will be dynamically allocated from coherent memory
    instead of regular memory if able.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_BUFFER_ALLOCATE, uint32_t);
    Indicates that a buffer of the active layer should attempt to
    dynamically allocate its pixel data buffer.  This will return failure
    if the driver has ownership of the buffer or it is already allocated.
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_LAYER_BUFFER_FREE, uint32_t);
    Indicates that a buffer of the active layer should attempt to free its
    dynamically allocated pixel buffer.  This will return failure if the
    buffer has not been dynamically allocated, or the driver has ownership
    of the buffer.
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_PIPELINE_MODE, GFX_PipelineMode);
    Sets the draw pipeline mode for the active context.  This determines
    the draw path that will be used for draw operations.  The choices are
    are pure software path, a graphics controller/driver path, a graphics
    accelerator path, or a combined GCU/GPU path.  This is useful as a means
    to quickly turn off acceleration features for demonstration purporses, or
    for disabling custom graphics controller driver draw functions for draw
    operations on a scratch buffer.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_MODE, GFX_DrawMode);
    Sets the draw mode for the active context.  This includes drawing shape
    outlines, drawing filled shapes, or drawing gradient filled shapes.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_COLOR, GFX_Color);
    Gets the draw color for the active context.  All simple raster operations
    use this color when writing to the write buffer.  The color value is
    expected to be in the same color format as the context.  Mismatching
    will result in rendering errors.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_GRADIENT_COLOR, GFX_Color, GFX_Color, GFX_Color, GFX_Color);
    Gets the gradient draw colors for the active context.  Gradient-based
    raster operations will use these colors for drawing.  The first two are
    used for liniear gradient modes and all four are used for bilinear
    operations.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_PALETTE, GFX_PixelBuffer*);
    Sets the reference palette to be used when performing indexed blit
    operations.  Applications decoding palette-based images must use this
    to set the palette before performing the blit operation.
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_TARGET, GFX_PixelBuffer*);
    Indicates that the given pointer is to be used as the target for all
    subsequent draw operations.  This redirects all draw operations away
    from the active write frame buffer.  Passing NULL to this function
    will disable an active draw target and refocus draw operations to the
    active write frame buffer.  This may need to be used in conjunction with
    GFXF_PIPELINE_MODE in Software or GPU only mode.    

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_THICKNESS, uint32_t);
    Sets the draw hint for thickness.  Raster operation algorithms may
    reference this value if they support drawing thicker primitives.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_BLEND_MODE, GFX_BlendMode);
    Gets the combined draw feature mask for the context.  This includes
    masking and alpha blending.
    
    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_RESIZE_MODE, GFX_ResizeMode);
    Sets the resize mode that will be used by stretch blit operations.
    Nearest neighbor is a faster but less-accurate algorithm and Bilinear
    is slower but more accurate.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_ALPHA_VALUE, uint32_t);
    Sets the global per-pixel alpha blending amount for the context.  This
    value acts as an alpha channel for every pixel drawn while enabled.
    Valid values are 0-255.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_MASK_ENABLE, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the per-pixel color masking (transparency) enabled flag.  This
    enables the color masking state of the per-pixel transformation
    pipeline.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_MASK_VALUE, GFX_Color);
    Sets the per-pixel color mask value.  During raster operations, the
    source pixel color will be compared to this.  If it matches the pixel
    will be discarded.  This comparison happens before any blending is
    applied and before the pixel is converted to the destination format.

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_CLIP_ENABLE, GFX_Bool);
    Sets the clipping enabled flag for the context.  

    GFX_Set(GFXF_DRAW_CLIP_RECT, GFX_Rect*);
    Any pixel that falls outside of this rectangle will be discarded.

  Returns:
    GFX_Result - Returns GFX_TRUE if the operation was processed
                 successfully. Otherwise returns GFX_FALSE.
