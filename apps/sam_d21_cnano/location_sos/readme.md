# Location Tagged SOS Application on SAM D21 Curiosity Nano and Nano Base for Click boards
-----

## Description:

> The application demonstrates the solution based on Microchip products in a personal emergency or
    in a situation to communicates a distress signal by sending out a location-tagged SOS SMS. The
    Mikroelektronika GSM-GPS click board, used in this application, contains a hardware module that
    combines the GSM/GPRS and GPS functionality used for tracking the device and sending out the
    emergency or distress signal. The MCU is interfaced with the GPS module over the UART interface
    to perform the acquisition and tracking of GPS coordinates. It registers the event callbacks for
    location tracking of the GPS receiver.

> The application arranges the GSM/GPRS module for sending SMS to a configured mobile phone number.
    Once the GPS position is available, the application sends the following location tagged SOS SMS to
    the configured mobile phone number when emergency switch is pressed.

> SAM D21 Curiosity Nano Location tagged SOS.  
    Please attend emergency at:  
    Latitude : xx.xxxxxx  
    Longitude : xx.xxxxxx  
    Altitude : xx.xxxxxx

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps.  

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "ATSAMD21G17D"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (location_sos\firmware\sam_d21_cnano.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "PKOB nano" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo:
- Open Tera Term, connect to serial console. If there is any connection issue on tera terminal, unplug
  the USB cable connected to Micro-B port and reconnect it back
- Change the baud rate to 115200
- Perform a reset by unplugging the power cable of SAM D21 Curiosity Nano
- After power up, The LEDs on GSM-GPS click boards gives the following indications:
	- LED marked STA is on; this indicates the GSM module is switching on
	- LED marked TXA is blinking, this indicates the GPS acquisition and position data is exchanged by the receiver
	- LED marked PPS is off. The PPS LED indicates pulse-per-second signal for precise timing. It glows on, after successful positioning
- After one minute, the GPS achieves successful position as indicated by the blinking of LED PPS.
### Note:
- The GPS on the GSM-GPS click has a one second Time-To-First-Fix (TTFF) from a hot start and 30 seconds from cold start
- If the position is not achieved after 1 minute, then:
	- It could be because of non-availability of GPS signals. Make sure that you have placed
	  the GPS antenna such that it can receive the signals from the GPS satellites. Try placing
      it under the open sky to be able to receive signals
	- After using the option above, if the device is still not receiving the position indication,
      try resetting the board by unplugging the power cable of SAM D21 Curiosity Nano board and
      turn off and turn on the battery supply by sliding SW1 switch on Curiosity Nano Base or unplug
      the power cable of GSM-GPS Click board
- Once the GPS position is achieved, user can press switch SW0 on SAM D21 Curiosity Nano board to send SMS to configured mobile number with GPS location.
- GSM module sends below message to configured mobile number
      SAM D21 Curiosity Nano Location tagged SOS  
      Please attend emergency at:  
      Latitude : xx.xxxxxx  
      Longitude : xx.xxxxxx  
      Altitude : xx.xxxxxx    
      http://maps.google.com/maps?q=loc:xx.xxxxxx(Latitude),xx.xxxxxx(Longitude)          
- User can change the mobile number by long pressing (more than 4 seconds) switch SW0 on SAM D21
   Curiosity Nano board. An option will be displayed on serial terminal to update the cell phone number
- Updated cell phone number is stored in NVM memory, updated number will be used further to send SMS,
   even after power reset
- If GPS position is not achieved, short pressing SW0 on SAM D21 Curiosity Nano board sends a blank SMS
   without GPS location.
