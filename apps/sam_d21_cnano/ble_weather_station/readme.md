# BLE based Weather Station and Motion Sensor Application on SAM D21 Curiosity Nano and Nano Base for Click boards
-----

## Description:

> The application demonstrates a solution based on Microchip products for environmental or weather industry products. The application demonstrates posting of weather and motion sensor data collected from the various sensors to android mobile application via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). The PTH (Pressure, Temperature and Humidity) collected from the Mikro elektronika weather click board and motion sensor data collected from the Mikro elektronika 10DOF Click are posted to the android application via BM71 Bluetooth module.   

> The host microcntroller (SAM D21) is interfaced to the weather click and  10DOF click over the I2C interface and BM71 XPRO over UART.

## Comments:
-  Other features on the application like the Step Count and Light are not supported by this demo. Navigating to these screens may lead to an undefined behavior.
- Code related for custom private services are added manually, harmony v3 framework doesn't generate code related to it.
