## <a id="setting-up-the-build-platform"> </a>
## Setting up the build platform
- Download and extract [ACK Device SDK 3.2](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ack/resources) from Amazon developer website.
- Copy and paste extracted  SAM D21 ACK port folder "samd21_amazon_ack" into ACK device SDK's user platform folder  
  `<Your ACK SDK Downloaded folder>/ACK_Device_SDK_3.2.202009091708/user/platform`

**Note**
- Make sure you create **amazon.com** account for downloading the SDK. You would use your Amazon credentials to register your development device (amazon.com account provides an option to register your development device.)
- "ACK Module with MediaTek chipset" is used in these demo's. make sure you download proper ACK SDK from the Amazon website


## <a id="project-structure"> </a>
## Project file structure
- ACK SDK file/directory structure, refer "Readme.txt" in  
`<Your ACK SDK Downloaded folder>\ACK_Device_SDK_3.2.202009091708\`
- SAM D21 ACK port file/directory is as follows
  - user/platform/samd21_amazon_ack/
    - **applications**                : Contains all the ACK host sample applications built on MPLABX Tools and xc32 compiler
    - **bootloader**                  : Contains bootloader for over-the-air(OTA) firmware upgrade feature
    - **hmcu_port**                   : Contains shared host specific platform and OTA files
    - **ota**                         : Contains OTA source, config and header files
    - **ack_samd21_cutom_loader.c**   : Contains bootloader specific code
    - **ack_samd21_platform.c**       : Contains SAMD21 platform specific code    

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps.  
## <a id="steps-to-program-the-hex-file"> </a>
### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "ATSAMD21G17D"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## <a id="programming-smart-light-application-project"> </a>
## Programming/Debugging Smart Light Application Project:

 <span style="color:blue"> *Before proceeding with this step complete "Setting up the build platform" step.* </span>
- Open the project (`samd21_amazon_ack/applications/SmartLight/firmware/sam_d21_cnano.X`) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "PKOB nano" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar

## <a id="register-your-device"> </a>
## Register your device
- [Register ACK Module](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ack/dev-kit-device-registration.html) with Amazon by following the procedure
- If you successfully registered your device. you should see the status LED on your ACK development board change from white to green.

## <a id="running-the-demo"> </a>
## Running the Demo:
- Open Amazon Alexa App from your phone if you closed it.
- Reset/power cycle the *SAM D21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit* and wait till the status LED on ACK development board turns to green.
- When you say "Alexa, turn on development device" or tap the power button in the Alexa app GUI. A LED0 on the *SAM D21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit* turns ON.
- When you say "Alexa, turn off development device" or tap the power button in the Alexa app GUI. A LED0 on the *SAM D21 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit* turns Off.  
- To turn off the LED after a specific timeout, use option "Turnoff timer" in Alexa app GUI and select the required timeout.
- To Toggle the LED and change the toggling speed, use option "Speed" in Alexa app GUI and select the required speed.

**Note**
 - To open Alexa app GUI for development device, In Amazon Alexa  app navigate to Devices > All devices and select Development device. it will provide the options to control the smart lights

## Comments:
- Brightness option using PWM is not implemented, trying to control brightness will result in OFF if value is less than 128.
- **Smart Light application is built as a standalone project, if you wish to implement OTA firmware upgrade feature to this application, follow the instructions in the bootloader application's readme file.**
- Reference Training Module: [Getting Started with Harmony v3 Peripheral Libraries on SAM D21 MCUs](https://microchipdeveloper.com/harmony3:samd21-getting-started-training-module)
- This application demo builds and works out of box by following the instructions above in "Running the Demo" section. If you need to enhance/customize this application demo, you need to use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Software framework. Refer links below to setup and build your applications using MPLAB Harmony.
- This solution is currently available only in US, Canada, and Mexico. Other regions contact Amazon.
