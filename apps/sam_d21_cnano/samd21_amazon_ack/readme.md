# Amazon Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) SDK port, Smart Applications and Over the Air (OTA) firmware upgrade on SAM D21 Curiosity Nano

-----

## Description:

> This folder contains the SAM D21 microcontroller port for Amazon's Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) Software Development Kit (SDK) and smart applications
demonstrating the port. The folder also contains Over the Air (OTA) firmware upgrade feature for the smart Applications.

> SAM D21 is an low-power, high-performance Microchip's ARM® Cortex®-M0+ based flash microcontroller, it is ideal for a wide range of home automation, consumer, metering, and industrial applications. Microchip offers a low cost SAM D21 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit to evaluate SAMD21G17D microcontroller.

> Alexa Connect Kit (ACK) is Amazon's managed service that makes it easy to integrate Alexa into your product With ACK, you don't need to write an Alexa skill, manage a cloud service, or develop complex network and security firmware to connect your product to Alexa. Instead, you integrate the ACK module into your product. ACK provides the managed services, software, and tools you can use to develop and manage your Alexa-connected products on an ongoing basis. Users can benefit from Alexa device control and other features, such as Amazon's Wi-fi Simple Setup (WSS).

> The communication interface between SAM D21 and ACK module is through UART.

- This folder contains a set of applications (under folder "**applications**) which uses Amazon Alexa connect kit (ACK) SDK with host microcontroller SAM D21.  
  - The Application "**HelloWorld**" demonstrates turning ON/OFF of the development device (SAM D21 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit)
  - The Application "**SmartLight**" demonstrates controlling of smart light (LED0) on development device (SAM D21 Curiosity Nano evaluation kit)
  - The Application "**Microwave**" demonstrates controlling of a Microwave oven
  - The Application "**DashReplenishment**" demonstrates dashboard replenishment  
- The folder contains a folder "**bootloader**". The bootloader helps demonstrate OTA firmware upgrade feature.

## Hardware Setup:
<span style="color:blue"> *Refer the documentation in individual application folder*</span>

## <a id="setting-up-the-build-platform"> </a>
## Setting up the build platform
- Download and extract [ACK Device SDK 3.2](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ack/resources) from Amazon developer website.
- Copy and paste extracted  SAM D21 ACK port folder "samd21_amazon_ack" into ACK device SDK's user platform folder  
  `<Your ACK SDK Downloaded folder>/ACK_Device_SDK_3.2.202009091708/user/platform`

**Note**
- Make sure you create **amazon.com** account for downloading the SDK. You would use your Amazon credentials to register your development device (amazon.com account provides an option to register your development device.)
- "ACK Module with MediaTek chipset" is used in these demo's. make sure you download proper ACK SDK from the Amazon website

## <a id="project-structure"> </a>
## Project file structure
- ACK SDK file/directory structure, refer "Readme.txt" in  
`<Your ACK SDK Downloaded folder>\ACK_Device_SDK_3.2.202009091708\`
- SAM D21 ACK port file/directory is as follows
  - user/platform/samd21_amazon_ack/
    - **applications**                : Contains all the ACK host sample applications built on MPLABX Tools and xc32 compiler
    - **bootloader**                  : Contains bootloader for over-the-air(OTA) firmware upgrade feature
